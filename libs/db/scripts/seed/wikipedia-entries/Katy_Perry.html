<p><b>Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson</b> (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as <b>Katy Perry</b>, is an American singer, songwriter and television personality. She is known for her influence on modern pop music and her camp style, being dubbed the "Queen of Camp" by <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Rolling Stone</i>. </p>

<p>At 16, Perry released a gospel record titled <i>Katy Hudson</i> (2001) under Red Hill Records, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles at 17 to venture into secular music, and later adopted the stage name "Katy Perry" from her mother's maiden name. She recorded an album while signed to Columbia Records, but was dropped before signing to Capitol Records.</p>

<p>Perry rose to fame with <i>One of the Boys</i> (2008), a pop rock record containing her debut single "I Kissed a Girl" and follow-up single "Hot n Cold", which reached number one and three on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 respectively. The disco-influenced pop album <i>Teenage Dream</i> (2010) spawned five U.S. number one singles—"California Gurls", "Teenage Dream", "Firework", "E.T.", and "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"—currently the only album by a female singer to do so. A reissue of the album titled <i>Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection</i> (2012) subsequently produced the U.S. number one single "Part of Me". Her empowerment-themed album <i>Prism</i> (2013) had two U.S. number one singles, "Roar" and "Dark Horse". Both their respective music videos made Perry the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on Vevo and YouTube. The electropop album <i>Witness</i> (2017) featured themes of feminism and a political subtext, while <i>Smile</i> (2020) was influenced by her recent motherhood and mental health journey. Afterwards, she embarked on her Las Vegas concert residency titled Play (2021–present), receiving critical acclaim and commercial success.</p>

<p>Perry is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold over 143 million records worldwide. She has the most U.S. diamond certified singles for any female artist (4). All of her studio albums released under Capitol have individually surpassed one billion streams on Spotify. She has nine U.S. number one singles, three U.S. number one albums and has received various accolades, including a <i>Billboard</i> Spotlight Award (currently the only female artist to have one), four Guinness World Records, five <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award. Perry has been included in the annual <i>Forbes</i> lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011 to 2019. Outside of music, she released an autobiographical documentary titled <i>Katy Perry: Part of Me</i> in 2012, voiced Smurfette in <i>The Smurfs</i> film series, and launched her own shoe line Katy Perry Collections in 2017. Perry began serving as a judge on <i>American Idol</i> during its sixteenth season in 2018. She is also the second most-followed woman and the sixth most-followed person on Twitter, with over 107 million followers.</p>



<h2>Life and career</h2>
<h3>1984–1999: Early life and family</h3>
<p>Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson was born on October 25, 1984, in Santa Barbara, California, to Pentecostal pastors Mary Christine (née Perry) and Maurice Keith Hudson. Both of her parents turned to religion after a "wild youth". Perry has English, German, Irish, and Portuguese ancestry. Through her mother, she is a niece of film director Frank Perry. She has a younger brother named David, who is also a singer, and an older sister, Angela.</p>

<p>From ages three to 11, Perry frequently moved across the country as her very strict parents set up churches before settling again in Santa Barbara. Growing up, she attended religious schools and camps, including Paradise Valley Christian School in Arizona and Santa Barbara Christian School in California during her elementary years. The family struggled financially, sometimes using food stamps and eating food from the food bank which also fed the congregation at her parents' church.</p>

<p>Growing up, Perry and her siblings were not allowed to eat the cereal Lucky Charms as the word "luck" reminded their mother of Lucifer, and were also required to call deviled eggs "angeled eggs". Perry primarily listened to gospel music, as non-religious music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends. Perry later recalled a story about how a friend of hers played "You Oughta Know" by Alanis Morissette, which impacted her songwriting and singing.</p>

<p>While not strictly identifying as religious, she has stated, "I pray all the time – for self-control, for humility." Wanting to be like her sister Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of her parents, who let her take vocal lessons like Angela was doing at the time. She began training at age nine and was incorporated into her parents' ministry, singing in church from ages nine to 17. At 13, Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday, and publicly performed songs she wrote. She tried to "be a bit like the typical Californian girl" while growing up, and started rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. Her brother David described her as a "tomboy" during her adolescence, which Perry talks about on her song "One of the Boys". She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug. Perry completed her General Educational Development (GED) requirements early at age 15, during her first year of high school, and left Dos Pueblos High School to pursue a music career.</p>

<h3>2000–2006: Career beginnings, <i>Katy Hudson</i>, and <i>Fingerprints</i></h3>
<p>Perry briefly had music lessons in facilities rented from the Music Academy of the West. Her singing caught the attention of rock artists Steve Thomas and Jennifer Knapp from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to improve her writing skills. In Nashville, she started recording demos and learned how to write songs and play guitar. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and recorded her debut album, a contemporary Christian record titled <i>Katy Hudson</i>, which was released on March 6, 2001. She also went on tour that year as part of Phil Joel's Strangely Normal Tour and embarked on other performances of her own in the United States. <i>Katy Hudson</i> received mixed reviews from critics and was commercially unsuccessful, selling an estimated 200 copies before the label ceased operations in December. Transitioning from gospel music to secular music, Perry started working with producer Glen Ballard, and moved to Los Angeles at age 17. She opted to work with Ballard due to his past work with Alanis Morissette, one of her major inspirations. In 2003, she briefly performed as Katheryn Perry, to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson, and later adopted the stage name "Katy Perry", using her mother's maiden name. In 2010, she recalled that "Thinking of You" was one of the first songs she wrote after moving to Los Angeles. Perry would also perform at the Hotel Café, performing new music while she was between record labels.</p>

<p>In 2004, she signed to Ballard's label, Java Records, which was then affiliated with The Island Def Jam Music Group. Perry began work on a solo record due for release in March 2005, but the record was shelved after Java was dropped. Ballard then introduced her to Tim Devine, an A&amp;R executive at Columbia Records, and she was signed as a solo artist. By November 2006, Perry had finished writing and recording material for her Columbia debut titled <i>Fingerprints</i> (with some of the material from this time appearing on <i>One of the Boys</i>) which was planned for release in 2007. Some of the material from <i>Fingerprints</i> that did not make it on <i>One of the Boys</i> was given to other artists, such as "I Do Not Hook Up" and "Long Shot" to Kelly Clarkson and "Rock God" to Selena Gomez &amp; the Scene.</p>

<p>Perry worked with songwriters including Desmond Child, Greg Wells, Butch Walker, Scott Cutler, Anne Preven, the Matrix, Kara DioGuardi, Max Martin, and Dr. Luke. In addition, after Devine suggested that songwriting team the Matrix become a "real group", she recorded an album, <i>The Matrix</i>, with them. <i>The Matrix</i> was planned for release in 2004 but was cancelled due to creative differences. It was released in 2009 after the release of <i>One of the Boys.</i> Perry was dropped from Columbia in 2006 as <i>Fingerprints</i> neared completion. After the label dropped her, she worked at an independent A&amp;R company, Taxi Music.</p>

<p>Perry had minor success prior to her breakthrough. One of the songs she had recorded for her album with Ballard, "Simple", was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film <i>The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</i>. Perry provided backing vocals on Mick Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard", which was included on the soundtrack to the 2004 film <i>Alfie</i>. In September 2004, <i>Blender</i> named her "The Next Big Thing". She recorded background vocals on P.O.D.'s single "Goodbye for Now", was featured at the end of its music video in 2006, and performed it with them on <i>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</i>. That year, Perry also appeared in the music video for "Learn to Fly" by Carbon Leaf, and played the love interest of her then-boyfriend, Gym Class Heroes lead singer Travie McCoy, in the band's music video for "Cupid's Chokehold".</p>

<h3>2007–2009: Breakthrough with <i>One of the Boys</i></h3>
<p>After Columbia dropped Perry, Angelica Cob-Baehler, then a publicity executive at the label, brought Perry's demos to Virgin Records chairman Jason Flom. Flom was convinced that she could be a breakthrough star and she was signed to Capitol Records in April 2007. The label arranged for her to work with Dr. Luke to add an "undeniable smash" to her existing material. Perry and Dr. Luke co-wrote the songs "I Kissed a Girl" and "Hot n Cold" for her second album <i>One of the Boys</i>. A campaign was started with the November 2007 release of the video to "Ur So Gay", a song aimed at introducing her to the music market. A digital EP of the same name was also released that month. Madonna helped publicize the song by praising it on the <i>JohnJay &amp; Rich</i> radio show in April 2008, stating "Ur So Gay" was her "favorite song" at the time. In March 2008, Perry made a cameo appearance as a club singer in the <i>Wildfire</i> episode "Life's Too Short" and appeared as herself during a photo shoot that June on <i>The Young and the Restless</i> for the show's magazine <i>Restless Style</i>.</p>

<p>Perry released her first single with Capitol, "I Kissed a Girl", on April 28, 2008, as the lead single from <i>One of the Boys</i>. The first station to pick up the song was WRVW in Nashville, who were inundated with enthusiastic calls the first three days they played it. The track reached number one on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. "I Kissed a Girl" created controversy among both religious and LGBT groups. The former criticized its homosexual theme, while the latter accused her of using bi-curiosity to sell records. In response to speculation that her parents opposed her music and career, Perry told MTV that they had no problems with her success. <i>One of the Boys</i>, released on June 17, 2008, garnered mixed critical reviews and reached number nine on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200. The album went on to sell 7 million copies worldwide. "Hot n Cold" was released the following September and became the album's second successful single, reaching number three on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 while topping charts in Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Austria. Later singles "Thinking of You" and "Waking Up in Vegas" were released in 2009 and reached the top 30 of the Hot 100. The Matrix's self-titled debut album, which Perry had recorded with the band in 2004, was released onto iTunes on January 27, 2009, as a result of her solo success.</p>

<p>After finishing the 2008 Warped Tour, Perry hosted the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2008, where she won the award for Best New Act.

Perry also hosted the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2009, becoming the first person to host two consecutive ceremonies of the European awards. On July 22, 2009, Perry recorded a live album titled <i>MTV Unplugged</i>, which featured acoustic performances of five tracks from <i>One of the Boys</i> as well as one new song, "Brick by Brick", and a cover of Fountains of Wayne's "Hackensack". It was released on November 17, 2009. Perry also appeared on two singles with other artists; she was featured on a remix of Colorado-based band 3OH!3's song "Starstrukk" in September 2009, and on a duet with Timbaland entitled "If We Ever Meet Again", from his album <i>Shock Value II</i>, three months later. The <i>Guinness World Records</i> recognized her in its 2010 edition as the "Best Start on the U.S. Digital Chart by a Female Artist", for digital single sales of over two million copies.</p>

<p>After Perry and Travie McCoy split up in December 2008, they briefly reconciled before she ended their relationship in 2009. Perry met her future husband Russell Brand in the summer of 2009 while filming a cameo appearance for his film <i>Get Him to the Greek</i>. Her scene, in which the two kiss, does not appear in the film. She began dating Brand after meeting him again that September at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.

<p>In August 2016, Perry stated that she aspired to create material "that connects and relates and inspires" and told Ryan Seacrest that she was "not rushing" her fifth album, adding "I'm just having a lot of fun, but experimenting and trying different producers, and different collaborators, and different styles". On February 10, 2017, Perry released the album's lead single "Chained to the Rhythm" featuring Skip Marley. It reached number one in Hungary and number four in the United States. The track was also streamed over three million times on Spotify within 24 hours, breaking the music streaming service's record at the time for the highest first-day streaming for a single track by a female artist. The album's second single, "Bon Appétit" with Migos, was released that April. Its third single, "Swish Swish", featured Nicki Minaj and followed the next month. They respectively peaked at numbers 59 and 46 in the United States, and made the top 15 in Canada.</p>

<p>The album, titled <i>Witness</i>, was released on June 9, 2017, to mixed reviews, and debuted at number one in the United States. To accompany the album's release, Perry broadcast herself on YouTube for four days with a live-stream titled Katy Perry Live: Witness World Wide, concluding with a live concert on June 12. The live-stream generated over 49 million views from 190 countries. She also embarked on Witness: The Tour, which began in September 2017 and ended in August 2018. On June 15, 2017, Calvin Harris released a song titled "Feels" from his album <i>Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1</i>, which featured Perry, Big Sean, and Pharrell Williams. The song went on to reach number one in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Perry subsequently recorded a cover of the <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i> song "Waving Through a Window" for the deluxe edition of the cast recording, which was released on November 2, 2018. The show's creators Benj Pasek and Justin Paul had requested Perry to cover the song to promote the musical's national tour and bring awareness to mental health. Later that month, Perry released "Cozy Little Christmas". She also recorded the song "Immortal Flame" for the game <i>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</i>, and had a playable character modeled after her.</p>

<p>Outside of recording music, Perry appeared as herself in the film <i>Zoolander 2</i>, which was released in February 2016. In February 2017, the singer launched a shoe line titled "Katy Perry Collections". Her shoes are available on her website, Katy Perry Collections, and at retailers such as Dillard's and Walmart. The following August, she hosted the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards. Perry was signed for a $25-million salary to serve as a judge on ABC's revival of <i>American Idol</i>, which premiered in March 2018. Perry began a relationship with Orlando Bloom in early 2016, and the couple got engaged on February 14, 2019.</p>

<p>At the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, Perry performed "Here You Come Again", alongside Dolly Parton and Kacey Musgraves, as part of a tribute to Parton. Four days later, she released a song called "365", with DJ Zedd. In April, Perry was included on a remix of Daddy Yankee's song "Con Calma", featuring Snow. She followed this with the singles "Never Really Over" on May 31, "Small Talk" on August 9, and "Harleys in Hawaii" on October 16. "Never Really Over" in particular received critical acclaim.</p>

<p>In June 2019, Perry appeared in the music video of Taylor Swift's "You Need to Calm Down". In July, a jury in California returned a verdict following a week-long trial that Perry's song "Dark Horse" had copied Flame's 2008 song "Joyful Noise" after he filed a copyright lawsuit alleging that it used his track's beat without permission; the verdict was later overturned. After the initial verdict, the jury ordered her to pay him $550,000. The next month, Josh Kloss, Perry's co-star in the "Teenage Dream" music video, accused her of sexual misconduct. In an Instagram post, Kloss alleged that, during a party at a skating rink, Perry pulled on his sweatpants and underwear, exposing his penis to her male friends. He also said her management prevented him from speaking about his time with the singer. However, Johnny Wujek, the creative director of said party defended Perry, saying that she "would never do something like that" and accused Kloss of having an "ongoing obsession" with her. After initially refraining from responding to this, believing it would have detracted from the Me Too movement, Perry has also denied Kloss's claims.</p>

<p>Following the release of her single "Never Worn White" in March 2020, Perry revealed in the accompanying music video that she was expecting her first child with Bloom. "Daisies", the lead single from her sixth album, was released on May 15, 2020. Its second single "Smile" followed two months later. The album, also titled <i>Smile</i>, was released on August 28, 2020. Two days before its distribution, she gave birth to a daughter named Daisy Dove Bloom. The album received mixed reviews, and debuted at number five in the United States. Perry further promoted the album with four compilation EPs: <i>Camp Katy</i>, <i>Empowered</i>, <i>Scorpio SZN</i>, and <i>Cosmic Energy</i>. These EPs were followed by the single "Not the End of the World" in December 2020, which had a music video in which Zooey Deschanel impersonates Perry. Additionally she collaborated with various artists to create two remixes of <i>Smile</i> album tracks. Tiësto remix of "Resilient" featuring Aitana was released in November 2020, while Bruno Martini remix of "Cry About It Later" featuring Luísa Sonza was released in April 2021.</p>

<p>On January 20, 2021, Perry performed "Firework" at the <i>Celebrating America</i> concert during the inauguration of Joe Biden. Four months later, she released a new single, "Electric", a collaboration with Pokémon as part of its 25th anniversary.</p>

<p>Perry began hosting a concert residency named Play at Resorts World Las Vegas on December 29, 2021. The show's inception happened during the COVID-19 lockdowns with Perry being inspired by <i>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</i>, <i>Pee-wee's Playhouse</i>, and <i>Pee-wee's Big Adventure</i>. She described it as "larger than life" and "the kookiest, most camp show I've ever put together." The show has received critical acclaim with Melinda Sheckells of <i>Billboard</i> saying that Play's "sold-out opening night is part fantasy, part hallucination and thoroughly camp. In addition to a sold out opening night, the <i>Santa Barbara Independent</i> reported that Perry's contract deal for the residency is worth $168 million dollars. It will conclude on November 4, 2023.</p>

<p>In September 2021, <i>Variety</i> paid tribute to and honored Perry on their "Power of Women" issue, where she discussed her career, motherhood, and philanthropy. As a nominee, she attended the <i>Variety</i> 2021 "Power of Women" dinner. On her 37th birthday the next month, Perry guest hosted <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i> and starred in a holiday advertisement for Gap Inc. which featured her singing "All You Need Is Love" by the Beatles. A full version of her cover was released on streaming platforms the same day. Two months later, Perry followed this with "When I'm Gone", a collaboration with Swedish DJ Alesso that made her the third person to reach number one on Croatia's ARC 100 list across three different decades following Lady Gaga and Coldplay. In January 2022, she and Morgan McLachlan established De Soi, a company which produces and sells non-alcoholic apéritifs. Both wanted a beverage that "would mellow the mind, minus the buzz" when creating it.</p>

<p>Along with Thomas Rhett, Perry recorded a country pop duet titled "Where We Started" for his album of the same name that was released three months later. That May, it was announced Perry would create music for the soundtrack to Jeremy Zag's animated musical film <i>Melody</i> and voice its title character. She also became the new face for Just Eat's, SkipTheDishes', Lieferando's, and Menulog's advertisements and created a new remix of their jingle. On June 8, 2022, Perry was awarded with the Key to Las Vegas, the same day it was marked as Katy Perry day.</p>

<p>Perry collaborated with the tech company Apple Inc. starring in advertisements for their GarageBand music software where users could have "Remix Sessions" featuring her song, "Harleys in Hawaii". On the collab, she stated in August 2022: "'Harleys in Hawaii' has lived so many different lives" as well as that there was "so much opportunity to remix this song, and I can't wait to hear all the GarageBand evolutions with this Apple collab." Perry performed at the Coronation Concert of Charles III the following May at Windsor Castle. In September 2023, she sold her music rights to Litmus Music for an estimated $225 million.</p>



<h2>Artistry</h2>
<h3>Influences</h3>
<div><div><div><div>Alanis Morissette (left) and Freddie Mercury (right) both heavily influenced Perry and her music.</div></div></div></div>

<p>Perry cites her sister Angela as the woman who has had the most influence on her. During the early stages of her career, Perry's musical style gravitated towards gospel and she aspired to be as successful as Amy Grant. At age 15, she heard "Killer Queen" by Queen, which inspired her to pursue a music career. She cites the band's frontman, Freddie Mercury, as her biggest influence and expressed how the "combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude" inspired her music. She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen. Perry described the Beach Boys and their album <i>Pet Sounds</i> as having a considerable influence on her music: "<i>Pet Sounds</i> is one of my favorite records and it influenced pretty much all of my songwriting. All of the melody choices that I make are because of <i>Pet Sounds</i>." The singer also holds the Beatles' album <i>The Beatles</i> in high esteem, and described these two albums as "the only things I listened to for probably two years straight."</p>

<p>She cites Alanis Morissette and her 1995 album <i>Jagged Little Pill</i> as a significant musical inspiration, stating in 2012: "<i>Jagged Little Pill</i> was the most perfect female record ever made. There's a song for anyone on that record; I relate to all those songs. They're still so timeless." Additionally, Perry borrows influence from <i>Flaming Red</i> by Patty Griffin and <i>10 Cent Wings</i> by Jonatha Brooke. Perry's autobiographical documentary <i>Katy Perry: Part of Me</i> was largely influenced by <i>Madonna: Truth or Dare</i>. She admires Madonna's ability to reinvent herself, saying "I want to evolve like Madonna".</p>

<p>Perry names Björk as an influence, particularly admiring her "willingness to always be taking chances". Other artists who Perry has cited as influences include Stevie Nicks, ABBA, the Cardigans, Whitney Houston, Cyndi Lauper, Ace of Base, 3OH!3, CeCe Peniston, C+C Music Factory, Black Box, Crystal Waters, Mariah Carey, Heart, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, Imogen Heap, Rufus Wainwright, Pink, and Gwen Stefani. "Firework" was inspired by a passage in the book <i>On the Road</i> by Jack Kerouac in which the author compares people who are full of life to fireworks that shoot across the sky and make people watch in awe. Her second concert tour, the California Dreams Tour, was reminiscent of <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> and <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>. She also credits the 1996 film <i>The Craft</i> for inspiring her song "Dark Horse", and Eckhart Tolle's book <i>The Power of Now</i> for influencing <i>Prism</i>.</p>

<h3>Musical style and themes</h3>
<div>

<blockquote>
<p>"When I am in between records, sometimes I doubt myself. I'll be like 'Did I just get lucky, or did I mass-manipulate the world into thinking that seven songs were worth a number-one position?' And then I go back into the studio and I start writing, and the true essential oil of who I am comes bubbling back up and reminds me that it's always been inside of me, that nobody can take this away no matter what comment anyone makes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Perry on her confidence as a songwriter</p>
</div>
<p>Although Perry's music incorporates pop, rock, and disco, <i>Katy Hudson</i> contains gospel. Her subsequent releases, <i>One of the Boys</i> and <i>Teenage Dream</i>, involve themes of sex and love. <i>One of the Boys</i> is a pop rock record, while <i>Teenage Dream</i> features disco influences. Perry's fourth album, <i>Prism</i>, is significantly influenced by dance and pop music. Lyrically, the album addresses relationships, self-reflection, and everyday life. Her fifth studio effort <i>Witness</i> is an electropop album that she described as a "360-degree liberation" record, with themes including political liberation, sexual liberation, and liberation from negativity. Many of her songs, particularly on <i>Teenage Dream</i>, reflect on love between teenagers; <i>W</i> magazine described the album's sexual innuendos as "irresistible hook-laden melodies". Self-empowerment is a common theme in Perry's music.</p>

<p>Perry has described herself as a "singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star" and maintains that honest songwriting is very important to her. She told <i>Marie Claire</i>: "I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable." Actress and comedian Kristen Wiig commented that "as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record." According to Greg Kot of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, "being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet." In 2013, <i>The New York Times</i> labeled her "the most potent pop star of the day– her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation". Randall Roberts of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent "clichés". Throughout her career, Perry has also co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Lesley Roy, Kelly Clarkson, Jessie James Decker, Selena Gomez &amp; the Scene, Britney Spears, Iggy Azalea, Rita Ora, Nicki Minaj, and Ariana Grande.</p>

<h3>Voice</h3>
<p>Perry possesses a contralto vocal range. Her singing has received both praise and criticism. Betty Clarke of <i>The Guardian</i> commented that her "powerful voice is hard-edged" while Rob Sheffield from <i>Rolling Stone</i> described Perry's vocals on <i>Teenage Dream</i> as "processed staccato blips". Darren Harvey of musicOMH compared Perry's vocals on <i>One of the Boys</i> to Alanis Morissette's, both possessing a "perky voice shifting octaves mid-syllable". Alex Miller from <i>NME</i> felt that "Perry's problem is often her voice" on <i>One of the Boys</i>, stating that "somewhere along the line someone convinced her she was like, well, a ballsy rock chick". Conversely, Bernadette McNulty from <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> praised her "rock chick voice" in a review of a concert promoting <i>Prism</i>.</p>

<p>On social media, Perry surpassed Justin Bieber as the most followed person on Twitter in November 2013. She won the 2015 Guinness World Record for most Twitter followers, and became the first person to gain 100 million followers on the site in June 2017. Keith Caulfield of <i>Billboard</i> stated that Perry is "the rare celebrity who seems to have enormous popularity but genuine ground-level interaction with her adoring KatyCats." With over 107 million Twitter followers, she is the second-most followed woman on the site, and the sixth most followed musician across social media with a combined total of over 385 million followers across Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. In June 2017, <i>Time</i> magazine listed Perry among its "25 Most Influential People on the Internet" of the year, writing that her live-stream for <i>Witness</i> was "blazing a trail" for being "the closest any major entertainer has come to giving fans the kind of 'real' intimacy that social media purports to provide".</p>

<p>Perry has been described as a sex symbol; <i>GQ</i> labeled her a "full-on male fantasy", while <i>Elle</i> wrote her body looked "as though sketched by a teenage boy". <i>Vice</i> called her a "'serious' popstar/woman/sex symbol". She was placed at number one on the <i>Maxim</i> Hot 100 in 2010 as the "most beautiful woman in the world", with editor Joe Levy describing her as a "triple– no quadruple– kind of hot". <i>Men's Health</i> readers voted her the "sexiest woman of 2013". In November 2010, Perry told <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> that she was proud of and satisfied with her figure.</p>

<p>Perry's fashion often incorporates humor, bright colors, and food-related themes such as her characteristic spinning peppermint swirl dress. <i>Vogue</i> described her as "never exactly one to shy away from the outrageous or the extreme in any realm", and called her the "Queen of Camp", while <i>Glamour</i> named her the "queen of quirk". In February 2009, Perry told <i>Seventeen</i> that her fashion style was "a bit of a concoction of different things" and stated she enjoyed humor in her clothing. She has also described herself as having "multipersonality disorder" for fashion. Perry lists Gwen Stefani, Shirley Manson, Chloë Sevigny, Daphne Guinness, Natalie Portman, and the fictional character Lolita as her style icons. In 2022, <i>Elle</i> dubbed her as "the kitsch-loving pop star renowned for her uniquely experimental style", while <i>Vogue</i> described her style as "synonymous with outrageous, eye-catching ensembles that lean towards the theatrical".</p>

<p>During the 2017 launch of her shoe collection, Katy Perry Collections, she said about shoes: "When I first got to L.A., I cultivated my style on a budget, always shopping at thrift stores or vintage stores. … Once, I found these flats that looked like Dalmatian dogs. They had ears that moved and a tongue that stuck out. They were such a conversation piece. That's what is so great about fashion. … It's a form of communication. You don't have to start a smoking habit to start talking to someone. You can just wear cool shoes. It's an icebreaker."</p>



<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Several media outlets such as <i>Billboard</i> and <i>Glamour</i> have referred to her as the "Queen of Pop", while others like <i>Vogue</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and <i>InStyle</i> have dubbed Perry the "Queen of Camp". Andrew Unterberger of <i>Billboard</i> described <i>Teenage Dream</i> "one of the defining LPs from a new golden age in mega-pop" while Christopher Rosa of <i>Glamour</i> named her as an influence to the pop sound and style of the 2010s, adding that her singles are "some of the most recognizable, iconic, and impactful hits in pop history." Perry was named "one of the last decade's most reliable and successful hitmakers" by the Official Charts Company in 2022.</p>

<p>Additionally, Perry was included in <i>Glamour</i>'s "104 Women Who Defined the Decade in Pop Culture" list of the 2010s. It stated Perry "did more than just break chart records. She was one of the driving forces behind the sound of pop radio in the 2010s" for her tracks that were "glossy, booming, sugary-sweet, and undeniably catchy." <i>Variety</i> included Perry in their <i>Variety</i> 500 list of the most influential business leaders, calling her a "global phenomenon" and a "dedicated artist and tireless self-promoter who has leveraged chart-topping hits, sold-out stadium shows, and staggering endorsement deals to become one of the richest and most influential pop stars alive." A 2017 journal published by <i>Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts</i> studying structural patterns in the melodies of earworm songs compiled lists of catchiest tracks from 3,000 participants, in which Perry's "California Gurls" ranked number six. She has been called a "gay icon" by Taylor Henderson of <i>Out</i>, noting how "I Kissed a Girl" helped fans explore their sexuality and how Perry openly embraced the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

<p>Perry's music has been described by <i>Out</i> as having a "lasting legacy", with American singers Fletcher sampling "I Kissed a Girl" and Olivia Rodrigo referencing <i>Teenage Dream</i> on "Brutal". Additionally, other artists such as Halsey and Ariana Grande have praised Perry's work, with Halsey calling <i>Teenage Dream</i> the "perfect pop album" and Grande saying "The One That Got Away" is "one of the biggest and most perfectly written pop songs ever from one of the best pop albums of all time." Perry and her work have influenced artists such as Lil Nas X, Halsey, BTS, Adele, Lorde, Sia, Bonnie McKee, Rina Sawayama, Doja Cat, Ellie Goulding, Tegan and Sara, Jessie J, Marina Diamandis, John Mayer, Jason Derulo, Lil B, Little Mix, Natalia Kills, Maren Morris, Hayley Kiyoko, Troye Sivan, Kim Petras, Yungblud, Mary Lambert, Issues, Rebecca Black, the Lonely Island, Tramp Stamps, Baba Sehgal, Grace VanderWaal, Dagny, and Coldplay.</p>

<p>Perry has publicly advocated for LGBT rights and admitted that she wrote "I Kissed a Girl" about her own bisexual experiences with other women. In 2017, she received a Nation Equality Award from Human Rights Campaign for "using her powerful voice and international platform to speak out for LGBTQ equality". In her acceptance speech, she discussed having bisexual experiences, her fluid sexuality, and thanked the LGBTQ+ community. In an <i>Out</i> interview in 2021, she was heralded as a "gay icon" with "I Kissed a Girl" being called a "bonafide queer anthem". Perry continued to thank the LGBTQ+ community in the same interview, saying: "I came from a very sheltered upbringing where it wasn't okay to be friends with anyone from that community. And now that is my community." She also mentioned "I wouldn't have survived without the community and it's amazing how full circle it's come and how much growth has happened since I started." Tomás Mier of <i>Rolling Stone</i> remarked Perry "championed queer folks, especially drag queens, throughout her career."</p>

<p>She dedicated the music video to her song "Firework" to the It Gets Better Project. In 2008, Perry told Do Something she was proud to be an LGBT rights activist, saying "I've always been a very open-minded person, but I definitely believe in equality." In June 2012, Perry expressed her hopes for LGBT equality, commenting "hopefully, we will look back at this moment and think like we do now concerning [other] civil rights issues. We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' That would be my prayer for the future." In December 2012, Perry was awarded the Trevor Hero Award by The Trevor Project for her work and activism on behalf of LGBT youth.</p>

<p>Perry identifies as a feminist, and appeared in April 2013 in a video clip for the "Chime for Change" campaign that aimed to spread female empowerment. She has also said that America's lack of free health care drove her "absolutely crazy". Following the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June 2016, Perry and nearly 200 other artists and executives in music signed an open letter organized by <i>Billboard</i> addressed to United States Congress demanding increased gun control in the United States.</p>

<p>Through Twitter and by performing at rallies, Perry supported President Barack Obama in his run for re-election and praised his support for same-sex marriage and LGBT equality. She performed at three rallies for Obama, in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Wisconsin, singing a rendition of "Let's Stay Together" as well as a number of her songs. During her Las Vegas performance she wore a dress made to replicate a voting ballot, with Obama's box filled in. On Twitter, she encouraged her followers to vote for Obama.</p>

<p>In August 2013, Perry voiced criticism of Tony Abbott, then-leader of conservative Liberal Party of Australia and candidate for Prime Minister of Australia, due to his opposition to gay marriage and told Abbott, "I love you as a human being but I can't give you my vote."; the statement came after Abbott expressed pride at learning of Perry's then-upcoming performance in Australia. In April 2014, she publicly supported Marianne Williamson in her campaign for California's 33rd congressional district by attending a political press event. She endorsed Kamala Harris in the United States Senate election in California, and organized a fundraiser for Harris at her home in Los Angeles in November 2016. Perry also publicly endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. She performed alongside Elton John at a fundraising concert for Clinton in New York City in March 2016. Perry also spoke and performed at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in support of Clinton. Four years later, she supported Joe Biden and Kamala Harris during the 2020 United States presidential election, praising the latter as a leader who had "experience we desperately need right now" and believed that the former "choosing her as his running mate is already a testament to his decision making". In 2022, Perry posted a picture of herself voting for Rick Caruso in the 2022 Los Angeles mayoral election.</p>
