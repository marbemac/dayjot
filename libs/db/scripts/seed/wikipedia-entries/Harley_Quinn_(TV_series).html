<p><i><b>Harley Quinn</b></i> is an American adult animated black comedy superhero television series based on the DC Comics character of the same name created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm. The series is written and executive-produced by Justin Halpern, Patrick Schumacker, and Dean Lorey, and follows the adventures of Harley Quinn and her best friend Poison Ivy after leaving her boyfriend, the Joker. The show premiered on November 29, 2019.</p>

<p>The show has received critical acclaim, with critics praising its animation, humor, dark tone, voice acting, and portrayal of the titular protagonist.</p>

<p>The first and second seasons premiered on DC Universe, before moving to HBO Max for its third season and then Max for its fourth. A standalone holiday-themed special episode premiered on February 9, 2023.</p>



<h2>Premise</h2>
<p>The series follows the adventures of Harley Quinn and her journey of self-discovery after breaking up with the Joker upon realizing that he never loved her. Harley intends to make a name for herself in Gotham City's criminal underworld, starting with the formation of her own crew, which consists of her best friend Poison Ivy, Clayface, Doctor Psycho, King Shark, and Sy Borgman. During her attempts to prove herself as a competent villain, Harley faces her troubled past, gains self-confidence that helps her abolish the Joker's influence on her, and finds an autonomous identity. </p>

<p>In addition to the adventures of Harley's crew, the main storyline revolves around the relationship between Harley and Ivy. Having met in Arkham Asylum when Harley was Dr. Harleen Quinzel and Ivy's therapist, the two developed a strong friendship that gradually deepened over the course of the series. They eventually realize they have feelings for each other despite Ivy's initial insecurity and her engagement with Kite Man. After a series of misadventures, during which Harley proves her selfless love to Ivy and Kite Man breaks up with her in favor of Ivy's happiness, Harley and Ivy become a couple by the end of season two. Over later seasons, the pair experience what it is to be in a healthy romantic relationship with mutual support, honesty, and self-determination.</p> 

<p>As the series progresses, more DC characters gain a bigger role in the story, primarily the members of the Bat Family and members of the Legion of Doom as Harley and Ivy figure out their respective goals regarding those affiliations. Harley realizes she wants to be a hero rather than a villain while Ivy discovers her inner villainess and the true potential of her superpowers. Apart from them, other members of Harley's crew begin to follow their own path, such as King Shark becoming a father and the ruler of the Shark Kingdom, and Clayface, who breaks out as an actor. Most of the seasons also contain a standalone episode that does not feature Harley or Ivy but focuses on one of the supporting characters, such as Joker, Batman, or Bane.</p>

Harvey Dent and Commissioner Gordon to interview Joker about a bomb he hid in Gotham before he was imprisoned at Arkham. After a difficult first meeting, Harleen becomes inspired by a spiteful Ivy to ask about Joker's family. He tells her a heartfelt backstory about his abusive father to earn her trust before telling her the bomb is in Little Italy in exchange for having a private meal with her. While Batman and the authorities are distracted, Joker reveals he put the bomb in the prison chef nicknamed "Little Italy" and tries to kidnap Harleen. However, Ivy rescues her in return for a plant Harleen gave her. Once Harley finishes reminiscing, Ivy reveals Joker's backstory was actually hers before they bring in Doctor Psycho, who confirms the Joker has no memory of his old self. On their way out, Harley and Ivy get captured by Two-Face.</td></tr>

When he attempts to gas the building to force them out, they create an explosion to escape. However, the heat magnifies the atmosphere enough that Luthor can use his laser and block the Sun. Consequently, Gotham's society crumbles into chaos in six days. When Harley and Ivy return from the future, the time sphere gets destroyed, and they realize that Luthor's goal was to render Superman powerless.</td></tr>

Harley and Ivy discover that Harley has a clone, unknowingly created by Gordon with the Legion of Doom's cloning device. Being more of a rule follower, she suggests Ivy use her LexCorp board membership to vote Luthor out so they can legally turn off his ozone laser. To secure the last vote, Ivy organizes a golf tournament to sway an influential board member but accidentally kills him. Nonetheless, his wife votes against Luthor because Harley had previously saved her life, allowing Ivy to shut down Luthor's machine. Meanwhile, Clone Harley reveals she witnessed Harley killing Nightwing during one of her sleepwalking episodes, which Psycho confirms by entering Harley's memory, though she asks the Flash to turn back time five minutes to prevent him from knowing it. Clone Harley intends to arrest Harley as she did with other people whom she considered criminals for even minor mistakes, leading Harley to fight and destroy her clone. Ashamed of her actions and realizing her failure as a hero, Harley announces to Batgirl she is quitting the Bat Family before the Joker shoots Batgirl.</td></tr>

<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>On November 20, 2017, it was announced that the then-unnamed DC Universe had ordered 26 episodes of <i>Harley Quinn</i>, a half-hour adult animated action-comedy series created and written by Justin Halpern, Patrick Schumacker and Dean Lorey. Executive producers were set to include Halpern, Schumacker, Lorey, and Sam Register with Jennifer Coyle serving as a producer. Production companies involved in the series were slated to consist of Ehsugadee Productions and Warner Bros. Animation. The first season consists of 13 episodes of the initial 26-episode order. Animation work is provided by NE4U, Digital eMation and Maven Image Platform in South Korea.</p>

<p>In June 2018, it was announced that the series would premiere in 2019. In October, it was further mapped as an October 2019 premiere. It was also reported that Kaley Cuoco would also serve as an executive producer for the series through her production company Yes, Norman Productions.</p>

<p>It was revealed that a second season was produced and consisted of another 13 episodes.</p>

<p>On September 18, 2020, three months after the second-season finale, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a third season, and would move to HBO Max. In February 2021, series creator Patrick Schumacker announced that they had begun recording season 3.</p>

<p>In June 2021, it was revealed that a planned oral sex scene between Catwoman and Batman in season 3 was cut by DC. It was replaced by a scene of Batman not being good at giving Catwoman a foot massage.</p>

<p>Schumacker stated the third season was more difficult to produce, but it will be much simpler not having to create two seasons back to back. Halpern has stated in an interview with <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> that season 3 will explore Harley's reaction to a half healthy relationship with Ivy as well as focusing more on Ivy's backstory as the previous two seasons were mainly focused on Harley. Schumacker said that new writers from the LGBTQ+ community have been hired because of the direction of season 2 and that it is a priority to diversify the staff for season 3. Schumacker also revealed that Dean Lorey would no longer be available to return as showrunner for season 3 and would be replaced by new co-showrunners Chrissy Pietrosh and Jessica Goldstein alongside him and Justin Halpern. Composer Jefferson Friedman revealed there would be a musical episode coming, and also stated that he wanted to refresh the music to give identity for each character. During an interview with <i>Deadline Hollywood,</i> Schumacker stated that his desire was to open season 3 on "an actual Zoom, where the GCPD is just being berated by the city of Gotham for their ineptitude". In February 2021, series creator Patrick Schumacker announced that they had begun recording season 3.</p>

<p>At DC FanDome 2021, Harley, King Shark, and Kite Man previewed some animatic footage from the third season, and announced it would be coming to HBO Max "sometime in 2022".</p>

<p>A comic prequel to season 3 was first released on August 3, 2021, under the title <i>Harley Quinn: The Animated Series – The Eat. Bang! Kill. Tour</i> by Tee Franklin (author), Max Sarin (cover art, penciller, inker), and Marissa Louise (colorist), in which Harley takes Ivy on a honeymoon where they face friends they've betrayed, their own feelings about how season 2 ended, and a few villains and heroes along the way. Commissioner Gordon tries to catch them repeatedly, causing Batman and Batgirl to worry about his sanity.</p>

<p>On August 9, 2022, it was announced that a fourth season is in development. On August 31, 2022, HBO Max renewed the series for a fourth season with Sarah Peters promoted to executive producer and showrunner, since Halpern and Schumacker will be busy with <i>Kite Man: Hell Yeah!</i>. On October 7, 2022, it was reported that the series is getting a holiday special called "Harley Quinn: A Very Problematic Valentine's Day Special" which was released in February 2023. The fourth season premiered on July 27, 2023.</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<p>Alongside the series order announcement, it was reported that the producers of the series were expected to approach Margot Robbie, who portrays the character in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), to reprise the role; but this was false. In an interview after the season 1 release, Halpern went on record saying Robbie was kept in the loop, but she was never interested in playing the role since she was filming and producing <i>Birds of Prey</i> at the time. Other characters expected to be featured in the series included Joker, Poison Ivy, Sy Borgman, Doctor Psycho, Malice Vundabar, King Shark, and Clayface.</p>

<p>On October 3, 2018, it was announced that Cuoco would voice Harley Quinn and Lake Bell would voice Poison Ivy. Additional voice actors in the series include Alan Tudyk as Joker and Clayface, Ron Funches as King Shark, J. B. Smoove as Frank the Plant, Jason Alexander as Sy Borgman, Wanda Sykes as the Queen of Fables, Giancarlo Esposito as Lex Luthor, Natalie Morales as Lois Lane, Jim Rash as Riddler, Diedrich Bader reprising his role from <i>Batman: The Brave and the Bold</i> as Batman himself, Tony Hale as Dr. Psycho and Christopher Meloni as James Gordon. Shortly after, Rahul Kohli revealed he would voice Scarecrow in the series. In June 2019, Sanaa Lathan was revealed to be voicing Catwoman, who was depicted as African-American. On July 24, 2019, Vanessa Marshall revealed to be reprising Wonder Woman from <i>Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths</i> and <i>Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox</i>. While on the following day, <i>TV Guide</i> revealed that veteran voice actor Charlie Adler has been confirmed to serve as the series' additional voice director with Schumacker and Lorey serving as the voice directors. In February 2020, Alfred Molina was announced to be voicing Mr. Freeze. In April 2020, Schumacker confirmed that Michael Ironside would be reprising his role as Darkseid from both the DC Animated Universe and the <i>Lego DC Super-Villains</i> video game.</p>

<p>In June 2021, Sam Richardson was announced as having joined the cast as Swamp Thing. In March 2022, filmmaker–later co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios, James Gunn announced he will voice himself in the show's third season; the showrunners contacted him on Twitter about making an appearance, knowing he was a fan of the show. Gunn recorded his lines remotely, as he was directing his DCEU series <i>Peacemaker</i> in Vancouver, Canada, while season 3 was being developed. That same month, Harvey Guillén was cast to play Nightwing.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Jefferson Friedman composed the music for the series. WaterTower Music released the soundtrack album for season 1 on August 21, 2020. The season 2 album was released on the same day.</p>

<h3>LGBTQ representation</h3>

<p>In the DC Universe, Harley Quinn (Dr. Harleen Quinzel) and Poison Ivy (Dr. Pamela Isley) started as friends. In the comics, Harley and Ivy even referred to each other as "Peanut" and "Pam-A-Lamb". The writers took notice giving them moments of birthday kisses and taking showers together making their friendship more intimate. Harley Quinn's and Poison Ivy's relationship took a turn in <i>Gotham City Sirens</i> when Harley whispers into Ivy's ear that the reason she "saves her" from the Joker is due to her romantic feelings for her, although the scene ends with Harley going back to Joker. It was not until the 2013 Amanda Connor and Jimmy Palmiotti's <i>Harley Quinn</i> comic series where they are shown in a romantic coupling instead of friendship. Harley refers to Ivy as her "hot girlfriend" and the two are in an open relationship where they can pursue other partners while remaining dedicated to each other. Outside the main universe, Harley and Ivy even got married in <i>Injustice 2</i>.</p>

<p>In the May 15, 2020, episode "There's No Place to Go But Down" Harley Quinn saved her partner-in-crime, Poison Ivy; both kissed each other after they escaped from prison. One critic who reviewed the episode stated that Harley and Ivy's romance was a "slow burn", adding that this love affair could turn into a "more realistic exploration of how it feels to fall in love with a friend or to have an awkward hookup with a workmate". Another reviewer, Sophie Perry, writing for a lesbian lifestyle magazine, <i>Curve</i>, noted how queerbaiting has long endured in LGBTQ+ representation, noting how She-Ra and Harley Quinn both had same-sex kisses, happening within stories which could have turned out to be "typical queerbaiting" but did not. In another episode, Clayface, a member of Harley's villain crew, was revealed as a gay character who had a crush on a male student.</p>

<p>In June 2020, in an AMA on Reddit, Justin Halpern, co-showrunner of the series, admitted that the show missed subverting the trope of bisexuals being cheaters or prone to infidelity and promised to do better in the third season. Halpern also said, in later comments, that the show takes representation seriously, that both Harley and Ivy had relationships with women before, that Ivy had a crush on Catwoman, and explained how the relationship between Harley and Ivy developed.</p>

<p>In 2021, the series was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. The series was also nominated for several awards at Autostraddle's 4th Annual Gay Emmys, in the categories of "Best Episode with LGBTQ+ Themes" for the episode "Something Borrowed," and "Outstanding Animated Series". The trailer for the show's third season, which came out in October 2021, was described as showing that the series is "for the gays".</p>

<p>Caroline Framke of <i>Variety</i> wrote: "The animation feels like that of a typical Saturday morning cartoon, but its acidic scripts and shocking bursts of gore reminds you that <i>Harley Quinn</i> is taking full advantage of airing on a streaming service without censors. ... Sharp voice performances across the board from actors clearly relishing the chance to play in this world also prove too fun to resist. ... Most importantly, Harley gets to be an entire person all her own, as heartbreakingly naive as she is wickedly strange and funny." Robyn Bahr of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> wrote: "It's one of the best surprises of the year. ... 13 zippy, violent and irreverent half-hour episodes. ... The writing is frequently uproarious, chock full of Millennial nostalgia and cerebral gallows humor (the former may be low-hanging, rapidly-perishable fruit, but at least the show knows how to embrace its audience)."</p>
