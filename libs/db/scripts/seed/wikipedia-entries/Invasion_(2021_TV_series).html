<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>Apple gave an order for ten episodes in January 2019 with Simon Kinberg and David Weil creating, writing, and serving as executive producers for the series, with Audrey Chon also serving as an executive producer. <i>Deadline</i> reported that Chad Feehan was briefly brought in as a showrunner "out of necessity" but soon departed the series in September 2019. When the resumption of filming was announced, Jakob Verbruggen was listead as the director and executive producer of the series with Amy Kaufman, Andrew Baldwin, and Elisa Ellis also serving as executive producers; however, further reporting stated that Amanda Marsalis had also directed some episodes. The first season of <i>Invasion</i> was reported to have had a $200million budget. On December 8, 2021, Apple renewed the series for a second season.</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<p><i>Deadline</i> revealed in August 2020 that Neill, Anderson, Farahani, Nassar, and Kutsuna were all to be part of the cast.</p>

<h3>Filming</h3>
<p>Filming was originally planned to commence in mid-2019 with Kinberg directing but was delayed due to his work on the feature film <i>The 355</i>. According to a report by <i>Deadline</i>, <i>Invasion</i> planned to film in New York, Manchester, Morocco, and Japan. "Portions of the series had been shot in New York and Morocco, and producers were prepping for the UK shoot when the coronavirus-related industry shutdown started in mid-March." In February 2021, filming occurred in Greenwich, one of the last filming locations for the series. Filming for the first season concluded on March 15, 2021.</p>



<h2>Release</h2>
<p>The series premiered on October 22, 2021, with the release of its first three episodes; the first season concluded on December 10, 2021.</p>



<h2>Reception</h2>
<p>RogerEbert.com reviewer Nick Allen called the series "a thrilling series about people, not aliens", adding that the series "is a refreshing and often thrilling juggling of plot-threads that involve incredibly flawed or hurtful decisions made in the name of survival".</p>

<p>Andrew Webster, writing for <i>The Verge</i>, said that "Apple's <i>Invasion</i> feels like the first chapter of a sci-fi epic", adding "This all means that when the aliens do finally appear, it’s a huge deal."</p> 

<p>The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 46% approval rating with an average rating of 5.6/10, based on 41 critic reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, "<i>Invasion</i> attempts a slow burn but inadvertently lets its tension completely fizzle out with leaden pacing that will leave viewers impatient for the alien apocalypse to finally arrive." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 51 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".</p>

<p>Daniel Fienberg, writing for <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, said that "<i>Invasion</i> verges on 10 episodes of setup so pure and unfulfilling that a better title would be <i>Evasion</i>". He called the series, "amusing at first, then annoying, and finally, simply confusing", but praised Sam Neill's performance.</p>

<p>For the second season, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 64% approval rating with an average rating of 6.1/10, based on 11 critic reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, "A marked improvement if not a wholehearted vindication, <i>Invasion</i>'s second season explores the fallout of an alien takeover with impressive scope." Metacritic assigned a score of 63 out of 100 based on 4 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Chase Hutchinson, writing for <i>Collider</i>, said "In its ten-episode return, the science fiction series makes its first season more like a prologue for the story it really wanted to tell."</p>
