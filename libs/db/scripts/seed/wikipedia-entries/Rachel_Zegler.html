<p>In January 2018, director Steven Spielberg posted an open casting call via Twitter for a new film adaptation of <i>West Side Story</i>. Zegler, then 16 years old, responded to the casting call tweets with videos of herself singing "Tonight" and "I Feel Pretty"; she had performed the role at the Bergen Performing Arts Center in 2017.

For her performance, she received a Critics' Choice Movie Award nomination for Best Young Performer and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, making her the first actress of Colombian descent to win in that category as well as the youngest winner in that category at 20 years old.</p>

<p>Zegler starred as Anthea in the superhero film <i>Shazam! Fury of the Gods</i> (2023).</p>

<p>Zegler is set to play Snow White, alongside Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, in a live-action film adaptation of the 1937 animated Disney film, which is scheduled to be released in 2024.

<p>In June 2023, Zegler joined the cast in <i>Paddington in Peru</i>,  the third instalment of the <i>Paddington</i> film series with Hugh Bonneville, Emily Mortimer, Olivia Colman, and Antonio Banderas. However, in October 2023, it was announced that Zegler had backed out of the film to stand in solidarity with the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Zegler will be replaced by newcomer Carlo Tous in the role of Gina Cabot.</p>



<h2>In the media</h2>
<p>On September 27, 2021, Zegler was listed at number 34 on <i>The Ringer</i>'s <i>The Big Picture</i> podcast's list of the top 35 actors under 35. She is included in the <i>Forbes</i> 30 Under 30 class of 2022 list. On December 14, 2021, AP Entertainment named Zegler as one of the Breakthrough Entertainers of 2021. Zegler was part of the in memoriam segment of the 64th Annual Grammy Awards in honour of Stephen Sondheim, alongside Ben Platt, Cynthia Erivo, and Leslie Odom Jr.</p>

<p>On March 20, 2022, Zegler posted on Instagram that she had not been invited to attend the 94th Academy Awards ceremony to support her colleagues involved in <i>West Side Story</i>, which received seven nominations, including Best Picture. She wrote: "I have tried it all but it doesn't seem to be happening ... I will root for <i>West Side Story</i> from my couch and be proud of the work we so tirelessly did 3 years ago. I hope some last minute miracle occurs and I can celebrate with our film in person." <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> noted that the studios behind the nominated films determine the ticket allotments for those involved with the Best Picture nominees, with the exception of nominees for other categories and ceremony presenters. Russ Tamblyn posted in response to Zegler's post: "As a voting member and the original Riff, let me say: it's your duty to find Rachel a seat at the Oscars ... When they say representation matters, this is what that means. Please do right by her." The following day, the Academy invited her to be a presenter, and her shooting schedule for Disney's <i>Snow White</i> was reconfigured to allow Zegler to travel from London to Los Angeles to attend the ceremony. Zegler with Jacob Elordi presented the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.</p>
