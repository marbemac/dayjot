<p><b>Joseph Adam Jonas</b> (born August 15, 1989) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. He rose to fame as a member of the pop rock band the Jonas Brothers, alongside his brothers Kevin and Nick. The group released their debut studio album <i>It's About Time</i> through the Columbia label in 2006, which failed to achieve commercial success. After signing with Hollywood Records, the group released their self-titled second studio album in 2007, which became their breakthrough record. The band became prominent figures on the Disney Channel during this time, gaining a large following through the network: they appeared in the widely successful musical television film <i>Camp Rock</i> (2008) and its sequel <i>Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</i> (2010) as well as two of their own series, <i>Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream</i> (2008–2010) and <i>Jonas</i> (2009–2010).</p>

<p>The band's third studio album, <i>A Little Bit Longer</i> (2008), saw continued commercial success for the group; the album's lead single "Burnin' Up" hit the top five on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart. Their fourth studio album, while still successful on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart, saw a decline in record sales. After the group confirmed a hiatus, Joe released his debut solo studio album, <i>Fastlife</i> (2011), which saw moderate commercial success. After the Jonas Brothers officially parted ways due to creative differences, Jonas formed the funk-pop band DNCE in 2015, serving as the lead vocalist. The group saw the significant commercial success of their debut single "Cake by the Ocean", which peaked at number 9 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart in the United States.</p>

<p>In 2005, Joe, Kevin, and Nick recorded Please Be Mine, their first song recorded. Upon hearing the song, the Columbia Records president Steve Greenberg decided to sign the brothers as a group. They considered naming their group "Sons of Jonas" before settling on the name Jonas Brothers. While working on their debut studio album, the band toured throughout 2005 with artists such as Jump5, Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, the Backstreet Boys, and The Click Five among others. The group released their debut single, "Mandy", in December 2005. The album was initially scheduled for a February 2006 release date, though executive changes at Columbia's parent company Sony led to numerous delays on the project's release. During this time, the group began making appearances on various Disney Channel related soundtracks and toured with Aly &amp; AJ throughout 2006. The band's debut album, <i>It's About Time</i> (2006), was released on August 8, 2006. The album received little backing from the label, who had no further interest in promoting the band. The album's second single, "Year 3000", had its music video premiere on the Disney Channel in the beginning of 2007. Dissatisfied with how the release of the record was handled, the band hoped to depart from Columbia Records and find a new label; it was later confirmed in 2007 that the group had been dropped by the label. The album went on to sell a total of 67,000 copies in the United States.</p>

<p>Only a short period of time after their departure from Columbia Records, it was confirmed that the group had signed a new contract with Hollywood Records. While working on their new album, the group continued to gain popularity due to soundtrack appearances and promotional appearances. The group released their self-titled second studio album through Hollywood Records on August 7, 2007. The album entered the top five of the <i>Billboard</i> 200 in the United States, going on to sell over two million copies in the country. Joe and his brothers made their acting debut on an August 17 episode of the Disney series <i>Hannah Montana</i> titled "Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas". The band performed the collaboration "We Got the Party" with lead actress Miley Cyrus, with the episode gaining over ten million viewers and became basic cable's most watched series telecast ever. The group's single "S.O.S" became their first top twenty hit on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and has sold over 1.5 million copies in the country, they put out Hold On, When You Look Me in the Eyes among singles.</p>
