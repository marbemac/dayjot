<h2>Early life and family</h2>
<p>Cage was born in Long Beach, California, to August Coppola, a professor of literature, and Joy Vogelsang, a dancer and choreographer. He was raised in a Catholic family. His father was of Italian descent and his mother was of German and Polish ancestry. His paternal grandparents were composer Carmine Coppola and actress Italia Pennino, and his paternal great-grandparents were immigrants from Bernalda, Basilicata. Through his father, he is a nephew of director Francis Ford Coppola and of actress Talia Shire, and a cousin of directors Roman Coppola and Sofia Coppola, film producer Gian-Carlo Coppola, and actors Robert and Jason Schwartzman.</p>

<p>Cage is the youngest of three sons. His two brothers are New York radio personality Marc "The Cope" Coppola and director Christopher Coppola. He attended Beverly Hills High School, which is known for its many alumni who became entertainers. He aspired to act from an early age and also attended UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. His first non-cinematic acting experience was in a school production of <i>Golden Boy</i>. He said he started acting because he "wanted to be James Dean. I saw him in <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>, <i>East of Eden</i>. Nothing affected me—no rock song, no classical music—the way Dean affected me in <i>Eden</i>. It blew my mind. I was like, 'That's what I want to do'."</p>

<p>At age 15, he tried to convince his uncle, Francis Ford Coppola, to give him a screen test, telling him "I'll show you acting." His outburst was met with "silence in the car". By this stage of his career, Coppola had already directed Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Gene Hackman and Robert De Niro. Although early in his career Cage appeared in some of his uncle's films, he changed his name to Nicolas Cage to avoid the appearance of nepotism as Coppola's nephew. His choice of name was inspired by the Marvel Comics superhero Luke Cage and composer John Cage.</p>



<h2>Career</h2>
<div>Further information: Nicolas Cage filmography</div>

<h3>1981–1988: Early work and breakthrough</h3>
<p>Cage made his acting debut in the 1981 television pilot <i>The Best of Times</i>, which was never picked up by ABC. His film debut followed in 1982, with a minor role as an unnamed co-worker of Judge Reinhold's character in the coming-of-age film <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>, having originally auditioned for Reinhold's part. His experience on the film was marred by cast members endlessly quoting his uncle's films, which inspired him to change his name. Cage's first starring role came opposite Deborah Foreman in the romantic comedy <i>Valley Girl</i> (1983), in which he played a punk who falls in love with the titular valley girl, a plot loosely inspired by <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. The film was a modest box office success and has been branded a cult classic. He auditioned for the role of Dallas Winston in his uncle's film <i>The Outsiders</i>, based on S.E. Hinton's novel, but lost to Matt Dillon. Cage, however, would co-star in Coppola's adaptation of another Hinton novel, <i>Rumble Fish</i>, in that year.</p>

<p>In 1984, Cage appeared in three period films, none of which fared well at the box office. In the drama, <i>Racing with the Moon</i> (1984), Cage featured opposite Sean Penn as friends who are awaiting deployment to the U.S. Marine Corps. In Coppola's crime drama <i>The Cotton Club</i> he portrayed a fictionalized version of mob hitman Vincent "Mad Dog" Coll, earning praise from critic Paul Attanasio for "artully [using] his few moments to sketch a brawny, violent thug". His final release of the year was Alan Parker's drama <i>Birdy</i>, in which he starred with Matthew Modine as two close friends and their trauma inflicted by serving in the Vietnam War. Cage lost weight for the role and had two of his front teeth pulled out to appear disfigured. Despite massively underperforming at the box office, the film, and Cage and Modine's performances, received positive reviews, with <i>The New York Times</i> critic Janet Maslin writing, "Mr. Cage very sympathetically captures Al's urgency and frustration. Together, these actors work miracles with what might have been unplayable."</p>

<p>In 1986, Cage starred in the little-seen Canadian sports drama <i>The Boy in Blue</i> and his uncle's fantasy comedy <i>Peggy Sue Got Married</i> (1987) as the husband to Kathleen Turner's character, who has travelled back in time to their high school days. He then starred in the Coen brothers' crime comedy <i>Raising Arizona</i> (1987) as a dim-witted ex-con. Cage's biggest breakthrough came in 1987 with the romantic comedy <i>Moonstruck</i>, in which he starred alongside Cher as a hot-tempered baker who falls in love with his estranged brother's widowed fiancé. The film was a hit with critics and audiences alike, earning Cage a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy
 In his retrospective review, Roger Ebert wrote that he felt Cage's performance was worthy of an Oscar.</p>

<h3>1989–1994: Career slump</h3>
<p>In 1989, Cage starred in the black comedy <i>Vampire's Kiss</i> as a man who falls in love with a vampire and soon begins to believe he himself is a vampire. The film was a major box office flop, but has developed a cult following largely due to Cage's surrealistic and over-the-top performance appearing in internet memes. Critic Vincent Canby felt the film was "dominated and destroyed by Mr. Cage's chaotic, self-indulgent performance". After filming the Italian drama <i>Time to Kill</i> (1989) in Zimbabwe, he starred in David Lynch's romantic crime film <i>Wild at Heart</i> (1990) with Laura Dern as a pair of lovers on the run from gangsters hired to kill Cage's character "Sailor" Ripley. Cage was drawn to the project because he was "always attracted to those passionate, almost unbridled romantic characters" and it allowed him to impersonate one of his heroes, Elvis Presley, in scenes in which Sailor sings. <i>Wild at Heart</i> received mixed reviews upon release, despite controversially winning the Palme d'Or at 1990 Cannes Film Festival. Cage would reunite with Lynch and Dern for the avant-garde concert performance <i>Industrial Symphony No. 1</i>.</p>

<p>Also in 1990, he starred as a helicopter pilot in the action film <i>Fire Birds</i>, which was panned by critics and negatively compared to <i>Top Gun</i> (1986). Cage's next film, the erotic thriller <i>Zandalee</i> (1991), was released direct-to-video in the United States, where it did not receive a theatrical release. His "goofy 'everyman'" performance in the romantic comedy <i>Honeymoon in Vegas</i> (1992) garnered some positive critical notices, including from Roger Ebert, who defended Cage amidst some critics finding his acting "excessive" and earned Cage his second Gloden Globe nomination. He hosted an episode of the variety show <i>Saturday Night Live</i> to promote the film, his only time hosting the show.</p> 

<p>None of Cage's three films in 1993—<i>Deadfall</i> (directed by his brother Christopher), <i>Amos &amp; Andrew</i> and <i>Red Rock West</i>—performed well at the box office; though the last-mentioned neo-noir thriller in which he played a drifter mistaken for a hitman was lauded by critics. The comedy <i>Guarding Tess</i> (1994) paired Cage with Shirley MacLaine as a Secret Service agent protecting a former First Lady; however, it was dismissed as being derivative by some critics. He next starred alongside Bridget Fonda in the romantic comedy <i>It Could Happen to You</i> as a cash-strapped police officer who offers to share his lottery winnings with a waitress and then the much-criticized box office flop Christmas comedy <i>Trapped in Paradise</i> with the <i>Saturday Night Live</i> actors Jon Lovitz and Dana Carvey. According to Lovitz, Cage directed portions of the film because its director, George Gallo, offered little direction.</p>

<h3>1995–2003: Critical success and action star</h3>
<p>Cage's performance as a psychopathic criminal kingpin in the crime film <i>Kiss of Death</i> (1995) was seen by many critics as the film strongpoint, but his most acclaimed performance yet came in the drama <i>Leaving Las Vegas</i> as an alcoholic screenwriter who falls in love with a prostitute in Las Vegas. The role won Cage the Academy Award for Best Actor and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. To prepare for the part, Cage binge drank for two weeks and studied footage of himself.</p>

<p>In 1996, he starred alongside Sean Connery and Ed Harris in Michael Bay's <i>The Rock</i>, the first of a string of action films for Cage. In the film, he played an FBI chemical weapons specialist breaking into Alcatraz federal prison. <i>The Rock</i> was a box office and critical success, with journalist Alexander Larman stating the film "launched Cage into an unexpected vocation as an offbeat action star". Next, he starred in <i>Con Air</i> and <i>Face/Off</i>, two commercially successful action thrillers that were both released in June 1997. Along with John Cusack and John Malkovich, Cage led an ensemble cast  in <i>Con Air</i> as a parolee who must thwart an attemped prison break aboard a US Marshals aircraft. Jerry Bruckheimer, the film's producer, offered to the role to Cage after being impressed with his performances in <i>Leaving Las Vegas</i> and <i>The Rock</i>—Cage accepted despite disappointment at not being offered the villain role. Ebert felt Cage "[made] the wrong choice... by playing Cameron Poe as a slow-witted Elvis type who is very, very earnest and approaches every task with tunnel vision; it would have been more fun if he'd been less of a hayseed". John Woo's <i>Face/Off</i> saw Cage and John Travolta star in dual roles as sworn enemies—a terroist and an FBI agent—who both undergo face transplants to impersonate eachother, requiring Cage and Travolta to switch characters. Both performances were praised by crtiics, with the BBC writing in their review "Travolta and Cage invest their dual roles with physical subtleties that reflect the other actor's character".</p>

<p>After starring in these action films back-to-back, Cage decided to "return to more serious fare" in the romantic fantasy film <i>City of Angels</i> (1998), a loose remake of the German film <i>Wings of Desire</i> (1987) in which he played an angel who falls in love with a woman (played by Meg Ryan). Critics were split on the film and Cage's performance, with reviews ranging from describing him as a"endlessly resourceful" and "[resembling] a serial killer more than an angel". Brian De Palma's thriller <i>Snake Eyes</i>, his second film of 1998, starred Cage as a corrupt detective investigating a political assassination at a boxing match he is attending.. The film was met with mixed reviews, which were largely critical of its screenplay.</p>

<p>In 2002 he was again nominated for Oscar and Golden Globe best actor awards for his portrayal of real-life screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and Kaufman's fictional twin Donald in <i>Adaptation.</i></p> 

<p>Other films included Martin Scorsese's 1999 New York City paramedic drama <i>Bringing Out the Dead</i> and Ridley Scott's 2003 black comedy crime film <i>Matchstick Men</i>, in which he played a con artist with obsessive–compulsive disorder. Most of Cage's movies that have achieved financial success were in the action/adventure genre. These include <i>The Rock</i>, in which Cage plays a young FBI chemical weapons expert who infiltrates Alcatraz Island in the hope of neutralizing a terrorist threat, <i>Con Air</i>, a film where he plays a former army ranger who has to stop hijackers on an airplane, <i>Face/Off</i>, a John Woo film where he plays both a hero and a villain, and <i>Gone in 60 Seconds</i>, with Cage as a retired car thief.</p>  

<p>He took the lead role in the 2001 film <i>Captain Corelli's Mandolin</i> and learned to play the mandolin from scratch for the part. He made his directorial debut with 2002's <i>Sonny</i>.</p>

<p>In his second-highest-grossing film to date, <i>National Treasure</i>, he plays an eccentric historian who goes on a dangerous adventure to find treasure hidden by the Founding Fathers of the United States. In 2005, two films he headlined, <i>Lord of War</i> and <i>The Weather Man</i>, failed to find a significant audience despite nationwide releases and good reviews for his performances. The 2006 remake of <i>The Wicker Man</i> was very poorly reviewed, and failed to make back its $40-million budget.  The much-criticized <i>Ghost Rider</i> (2007), based on the Marvel Comics character, fared better, earning more than $45million (the top earner) during its opening weekend and over $208million worldwide through the weekend ending on March 25, 2007. Also in 2007, he had a small but notable role as the Chinese criminal mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu in Rob Zombie's fake trailer <i>Werewolf Women of the S.S.</i> from the B-movie double feature <i>Grindhouse</i> and starred in <i>Next</i>, which shared the concept of a glimpse into an alternate timeline with Cage's film, <i>The Family Man</i> (2000).</p>

<p>In November 2007, Cage was spotted backstage at a <i>Ring of Honor</i> wrestling show in New York City researching for the lead role for <i>The Wrestler</i>. However, Cage dropped out of production shortly afterward because he felt that he did not have enough time to prepare for the role and director Darren Aronofsky preferred Mickey Rourke for the lead role. Rourke would go on to receive an Academy Award nomination for his performance. In an interview with /Film, Aronofsky said of Cage's decision to leave the film that "Nic was a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but ... you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race."</p>

<p>In 2008, Cage appeared as Joe, a contract killer who undergoes a change of heart while on a work outing in Bangkok, in the film <i>Bangkok Dangerous</i>. The film is shot by the Pang Brothers and has a distinctly South-East Asian flavor. In 2009, Cage starred in the science fiction thriller <i>Knowing</i>, directed by Alex Proyas. In the film, he plays an MIT professor who examines the contents of a time capsule unearthed at his son's elementary school. Startling predictions found inside the capsule that has already come true lead him to believe that the world is going to end at the close of the week and that he and his son are somehow involved in the destruction. The film received mixed reviews but was the box office winner on its opening weekend.</p>

<p>Also in 2009, Cage starred in the film <i>Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans</i>, directed by acclaimed German director Werner Herzog. He portrayed a corrupt police officer with gambling, drug and alcohol addictions. The film was very well received by critics, holding a rating of 87% positive reviews on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Cage was lauded for his performance, with Michael Phillips of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> writing "Herzog has found his ideal interpreter, a performer whose truth lies deep in the artifice of performance: ladies and gentlemen, Nicolas Cage, at his finest." This film reunited Cage with Eva Mendes, who played his love interest in <i>Ghost Rider</i>. In 2010, Cage starred in <i>The Sorcerer's Apprentice</i>, in which he played the sorcerer, and the next year, headlined the period piece <i>Season of the Witch</i>, as a 14th-century knight transporting a woman accused of causing the Black Plague to a monastery. In 2011, Cage reprised his role in <i>Ghost Rider's</i> sequel <i>Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.</i></p>

<h3>2012–2017: Prolificity and direct-to-video films</h3>

<p>He voiced the character Grug Crood in the animated film <i>The Croods</i>, which was released in 2013. <i>The Croods</i> received positive reviews from critics and was a box-office success grossing $585million against a budget of $135million. In the same year he starred as main character in <i>The Frozen Ground</i>, a thriller crime drama film directed and written by Scott Walker in his directorial debut, based on the crimes of real-life Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen: The film depicts an Alaskan State Trooper, played by Cage, seeking to apprehend Hansen by partnering with a young woman, who escaped from Hansen's clutches. The film has received mixed reviews though Cage's performance was cited as a highlight and solid.</p>

<p>In 2013 he also starred in <i>Joe</i>, an independent crime drama film directed and co-produced by David Gordon Green, adaptation from Larry Brown's 1991 novel of the same name. In this film Nicolas Cage is a tormented man who hires a 15-year-old boy (played by Tye Sheridan) and protects him from his abusive father. The film premiered at the 70th Venice International Film Festival on August 30, 2013, with a subsequent screening at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. It was a box office flop, grossing only $2.36million from a $4million budget, but received critical acclaim from critics, who praised Cage's performance and Green's direction.</p>

<p>The 2016 black comedy <i>Dog Eat Dog</i>, Cage's second film with Paul Schrader, reunited him with Willem Dafoe (after <i>Wild at Heart</i>) as a pair of ex-convicts hired to kidnap a baby. The film had its premiere as the closing entry for the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 2016. It was released on November 4, 2016, in the United States. Peter Bradshaw of <i>The Guardian</i> gave the film four out of five stars, writing, "It's the right director for the right project and the result is Schrader's best for years: a lairy, nasty, tasty crime thriller built on black-comic chaos." Todd McCarthy of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> wrote, "A rare film to have been shot in Cleveland, <i>Dog Eat Dog</i> definitely looks like it was shot on the cheap but puts what it needs to up on the screen with vigor and wit."</p>

<p>Cage starred alongside Selma Blair and Anne Winters in Brian Taylor's horror comedy film, <i>Mom and Dad</i>, which premiered in the Midnight Madness section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. It was released in theaters on January 19, 2018, and received positive reviews from critics, with review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes defining his performance as "over-the-top". Director John Waters appreciated the film, naming <i>Mom and Dad</i> as one of the best movies of 2018, placing it fourth on his personal top list.</p>

<p>In 2018, Cage starred in the action thriller film <i>Mandy</i>, which premiered on January 19 at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com praised the movie, writing that "for all of the endless feral performances that Cage has given, in movies good, bad and forgettable, Cosmatos' style-driven, '80s-tastic passion for weird worlds and characters takes full advantage of Cage's greatness, and then some." In October, Mandy's producer Elijah Wood announced the intention to size up an Oscar campaign for Nicolas Cage and for composer Jóhann Jóhannsson (who died in February of that year) but the film was disqualified because it was also released on VOD on September 14.</p>

<p>Later that year, Cage voiced Clark Kent / Superman in the animated film <i>Teen Titans Go! To the Movies</i>. He had originally been slated to portray Superman in Tim Burton's canceled Superman film, <i>Superman Lives</i>, in the 1990s. He voiced an alternate monochromatic 1930s universe version of Peter Parker / Spider-Man Noir in <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i> (2018). Cage based his vocal performance on films of Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, and Edward G. Robinson.</p>

<p>On January 28, 2019, Viktor and Irina Yelchin premiered a documentary about their son Anton Yelchin, <i>Love, Antosha</i>, at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. The documentary was directed by Garret Price and contains various interviews with some of Anton's friends and collaborators like Kristen Stewart, J. J. Abrams, Chris Pine, Jennifer Lawrence, Jodie Foster, John Cho and Martin Landau. Cage starred as the Narrator of the film, reading various Anton's writings.</p>

<h2>Reception and acting style</h2>
<div>

<blockquote>
<p>"In Cage's hands, cartoonish moments are imbued with real emotion and real emotions become cartoons. Everything – from individual scenes down to single lines of dialogue – feel like they have been embraced as opportunities for creation. Cage is usually interesting even when his films are not. He is erratic and unpredictable; he is captivating and he is capricious. He is a performer. He is a troubadour. He is a jazz musician."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Luke Buckmaster, <i>The Guardian</i></p>
</div>

<p>In February 2011, Cage said that, at a certain point in his career, he realized that he had developed his own method of acting, which he described as "Nouveau Shamanic". He noted, "at some point I'll have to write a book" about it. Cage later explained that he drew the inspiration for the name from the book <i>The Way of the Actor</i> by Brian Bates, in which he read about the parallel between the ancient shamans and thespians. In other interviews, Cage defined his acting style using terms such as German Expressionism or "Western kabuki".</p>

<p>On some occasions, Cage stood up for his extreme method acting. For <i>Birdy</i>, in order to physically feel the pain of his character (a veteran from Vietnam War), Cage removed two teeth, which would have had to be pulled anyway, without any anesthesia. He also spent five weeks with his face wrapped in bandages, receiving brutal reactions by various people for his aspect. When he took the bandages off, his skin was infected because of acne and ingrowing hairs.</p>

<p><i>Vampire's Kiss'</i> casting director Marcia Shulman declared that Cage asked to have hot yogurt poured over his toes to get excited during a love scene with Jennifer Beals. He also studied Brazilian jiu-jitsu under the UFC champion Royce Gracie, for his roles in action films. During a 2012 interview promoting <i>Joe</i>, Cage revealed that he followed a diet based on red meat and steaks to gain weight for the role and to identify himself as a carnivore.</p>

<p>According to <i>The Guardian</i> film critic Luke Buckmaster, "any casual observer can see that Cage is entertaining, charismatic and wildly flamboyant". Attributing it partly to the "well-cultured" background of Cage's family, Buckmaster said the actor "is clearly attracted to grotesque characters and is celebrated for his wild and unhinged approach to them. He has the presence of a leading man, and the eccentricities of a character actor." Actor Ethan Hawke stated in 2013 that Cage is "the only actor since Marlon Brando that's actually done anything new with the art", crediting him for taking film audiences "away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadours."</p>

<p>Film director David Lynch described him as "the jazz musician of American acting". Many critics have accused Cage of overacting. Others, including Cage himself, have described his intentionally extreme performances as "mega-acting". After the actor's series of mainstream-marketed thriller films during the late 1990s, Sean Penn told <i>The New York Times</i> in 1999 that Cage was "no longer an actor" but "more like a performer". Despite this, in his speech after winning the Oscar for his performance in <i>Mystic River</i>, Penn described Cage's work (in <i>Matchstick Men</i>) as one of the best performances of 2003.</p>

<p>During the 2010s, a growing number of film critics described Cage as one of the most underrated actors of his generation.</p>

<p>In July 2021, Cage told <i>Variety</i> that he abandoned Hollywood because of the commercial constraints that were imposed on his performances and that he opted to work for low-budget independent films because they gave him more freedom to experiment and be fluid.</p>



<h2>Personal life</h2>
<h3>Relationships and family</h3>
<p>In 1988, Cage began dating actress Christina Fulton, with whom he has a son, Weston Coppola Cage (born December 26, 1990). Weston has been involved in two black metal bands, and appeared in his father's film <i>Lord of War</i> as a helicopter mechanic. Through Weston, Cage has two grandsons born in 2014 and 2016.</p>

<p>Cage has been married five times. His first wife was actress Patricia Arquette, whom he married in April 1995 and divorced in 2001.</p>

<p>Cage's second marriage was to singer-songwriter Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis and Priscilla Presley. (Cage, an Elvis fan, used Elvis as the inspiration for his performance in <i>Wild at Heart</i>.) They married in Kamuela, Hawaii, on August 10, 2002, and filed for divorce 107 days later on November 25, 2002. The divorce was finalized on May 24, 2004.</p>

<p>Cage's third wife was Alice Kim. They were married at a private ranch in northern California on July 30, 2004. She gave birth to their son Kal-El (after Superman's birth name) on October 3, 2005. They divorced in January 2016.</p>

<p>In March 2019, Cage married Erika Koike in Las Vegas, only to file for annulment four days later. He was granted a divorce from Koike three months later.</p>

<p>On February 16, 2021, Cage married Riko Shibata. Their daughter, August Francesca, was born on September 7, 2022.</p>

<h3>Political views and religious beliefs</h3>
<p>Cage grew up in a family of Catholic background, but does not talk about religion publicly and refuses to answer religion-connected questions in his interviews. When asked about whether he could relate to his character's lack of religious belief in <i>Knowing</i> , Cage replied, "You know, any of my personal beliefs or opinions run the risk of impinging on your own relationship with the movie. I think movies are best left enigmatic. Left raising more questions than answers. I don't want to ever preach, so that's what you get from a movie; that's far more interesting than anything I could offer."</p>

<p>During his visit to University of California, Santa Cruz, he stated that he is not a politically active actor and that he can do it in his work as he learned "more about nuclear power from the movie <i>The China Syndrome</i>". Cage endorsed Andrew Yang for president during the 2020 election.</p>

<p>At one point in his life, Cage had decided that he wanted to develop the philosophical aspect of his nature, and he went on a quest to find the Holy Grail. Cage traveled to England to look for it, but also looked at some areas of the United States.</p>

<h3>Charitable activities</h3>
<p>Cage has been called one of the most generous stars in Hollywood. He donated $2million to Amnesty International for them to use to offer rehabilitation shelters, medical services and psychological and reintegration services to some of the 300,000 children forced to fight in conflicts across the world. He has also donated $1million to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. He became the first artist to support ArtWorks, an artist engagement program to raise awareness of fundamental rights at work, including freedom from slavery and from child labor. During 2023, while filming The Surfer in Western Australia, Cage personally phoned in an AU$5,000 donation to the Channel Seven Perth Telethon.</p>

<p>Cage has also been honored with a Humanitarian award from the United Nations for his works and appointed as a UN ambassador for Global Justice in 2009 and again in 2013. He led a campaign around the film <i>Lord of War</i> to raise awareness about international arms control, supported "Heal the Bay", the United Negro College Fund efforts, and the Royal United Hospital's Forever Friends Appeal to build intensive care units for babies.</p>

<h3>Real estate and tax problems</h3>

<p>Nicolas Cage was once considered one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors, earning $40million in 2009 according to <i>Forbes</i>, although he failed to make <i>Forbes'</i> Top 10 List in 2014. Cage had a Malibu home where he and Kim lived, but sold the property in 2005 for $10million. In 2004 he bought a property on Paradise Island, Bahamas. In May 2006, he bought a 40-acre (16ha) island in the Exuma archipelago, some 85 miles (137km) southeast of Nassau and close to a similar island owned by Faith Hill and Tim McGraw. He bought the medieval castle Schloss Neidstein in the Oberpfalz region in Germany in 2006 and sold it in 2009 for $2.5million. His grandmother was German, living in Cochem an der Mosel.</p>

<p>In August 2007, Cage purchased "Grey Craig", a 24,000-square-foot (2,200m) brick-and-stone country manor in Middletown, Rhode Island. With an estate occupying 26 acres (11ha), the home has 12 bedrooms and 10 full bathrooms and overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. It borders the Norman Bird Sanctuary to the west. The sale ranked among the state of Rhode Island's most expensive residential purchases. Also in 2007, Cage purchased Midford Castle in Somerset, England. Shortly after selling his German castle, Cage also put his homes in Rhode Island, Louisiana, Nevada, and California, as well as a $7-million island in the Bahamas, on the market.</p>

<p>On July 14, 2009, the Internal Revenue Service filed documents in New Orleans in connection with a federal tax lien against property owned by Cage in Louisiana, concerning unpaid federal taxes. The IRS alleged that Cage failed to pay over $6.2million in federal income tax for the year 2007. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service had another lien for more than $350,000 in unpaid taxes dating from 2002 to 2004. Cage filed a $20-million lawsuit on October 16, 2009, against his business manager, Samuel J. Levin, alleging negligence and fraud. The lawsuit stated that Levin "had failed to pay taxes when they were due and had placed [Cage] in speculative and risky real estate investments 'resulting in (the actor) suffering catastrophic losses.'" Cage also faced separate lawsuits from East West Bank and Red Curb Investments for unpaid, multi-million dollar loans.</p>

<img alt="Three-storey rectangular building" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/1140_Royal_Street.jpg/170px-1140_Royal_Street.jpg" height="174" width="170" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/1140_Royal_Street.jpg/255px-1140_Royal_Street.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/1140_Royal_Street.jpg/340px-1140_Royal_Street.jpg 2x" />The LaLaurie Mansion in New Orleans was purchased anonymously by Cage in 2007 and sold in 2009.

<p>Samuel Levin filed a counter-complaint and responded to the lawsuit in a filing stating that he warned Cage that he was living beyond his means and urged him to spend less. Levin's filing states that "instead of listening to Levin, cross-defendant Cage (Coppola) spent most of his free time shopping for high ticket purchases, and wound up with 15 personal residences." Levin's complaint continued: "Likewise, Levin advised Coppola against buying a Gulfstream jet, against buying and owning a flotilla of yachts, against buying and owning a squadron of Rolls Royces, against buying millions of dollars in jewelry and art."</p>

<p>In his filing, Levin said that in 2007, Cage's "shopping spree entailed the purchase of three additional residences at a total cost of more than $33 million; the purchase of 22 automobiles (including 9 Rolls Royces), 12 purchases of expensive jewelry, and 47 purchases of artwork and exotic items." One of those items was a dinosaur skull of a <i>Tarbosaurus</i>. After discovering that it was stolen, he returned it to the Mongolian authorities.</p>

<p>According to Cage, he owned the "Most Haunted House in America", a home located in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. Known as "The LaLaurie House" after its former owner Delphine LaLaurie, the house was foreclosed and sold at auction on November 12, 2009, along with another New Orleans property for a total of $5.5million, in the wake of Cage's financial problems. His Bel Air home, which had six loans totaling $18million on it, failed to sell at an April 2010 foreclosure auction despite an opening offer of $10.4million, substantially less than the $35million that Cage had originally tried to sell it for. The home, built in 1940 for $110,000, had been owned at different times by Dean Martin and singer Tom Jones.</p>

<p>The home eventually sold in November 2010 for $10.5million. Another home in Nevada also faced foreclosure auction. In November 2011, Cage sold his <i>Action Comics</i> #1 in an online auction managed by Heritage Auctions for a record-breaking $2.16million (the previous record being $1.5million), to assist paying his tax liens and other debts. Cage purchased the comic in 1997 for $110,000. The comic had been stolen from him in 2000, and Cage had received an insurance payment on the item. In March 2011, it was found in a storage locker in the San Fernando Valley and was verified by ComicConnect.com to be the copy sold to Cage previously. Worth around $25million by May 2017, Cage was reportedly "taking [film] roles left and right" in order to pay off his remaining debts. By 2022, Cage confirmed that he had finally paid off his debts and intended to be more selective with his film roles.</p>

<h3>Legal issues</h3>
<p>Kathleen Turner wrote in her 2008 memoir, <i>Send Your Roses</i>, that Cage had stolen a chihuahua and was arrested twice for driving drunk while they filmed <i>Peggy Sue Got Married</i>. Later she admitted Cage did not steal a chihuahua and she was sorry. Cage won a libel action against Turner, her publisher Headline Publishing Group, and Associated Newspapers (whose publication the <i>Daily Mail</i> had repeated the allegations when they published an excerpt from the book). Christina Fulton sued Cage in December 2009 for $13million and for the house in which she was living. The suit was in response to an order that she leave the dwelling; the order resulted from Cage's financial difficulties. The case was settled in June 2011.</p>

<p>Cage was arrested in New Orleans' French Quarter district on April 15, 2011, for suspicion of domestic abuse battery, disturbing the peace and public intoxication. A police officer was flagged down by onlookers after Cage allegedly grabbed his wife's upper arm while appearing to be under the influence of alcohol. Cage was held in police custody until a bail of $11,000 was posted by Duane "Dog" Chapman. He was later ordered to appear in court on May 31, 2011. The New Orleans District Attorney announced that the charges against Cage had been dropped on May 5, 2011.</p>
