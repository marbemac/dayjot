<i>The Morning Show</i>, a popular news and talk morning television show, is thrown into chaos when co-anchor Mitch Kessler is fired amid allegations of sexual misconduct. His co-anchor Alex Levy is furious at the network for keeping her in the dark and later meets with Mitch, who reveals the network has been planning on replacing her. Elsewhere, young "conservative" reporter Bradley Jackson becomes an internet viral sensation after a video of her angrily fact-checking a coal mine supporter at a protest is posted on social media. Bradley quits her local network following a confrontation with her boss, and, after an argument with her family, is asked to appear on <i>The Morning Show</i> for an interview. Alex is skeptical about Bradley's claim that she was unaware of being filmed and presses her during the interview, but Bradley pushes back and doesn't give in.

Cory arranges a meeting for Bradley with the show's executive producer, Chip Black, to see if she might become a field correspondent. His dismissive manner sets Bradley off, leaving her sure she has ruined her chances of getting the job. In the middle of a meeting for contract negotiations, and knowing the network needs her to stabilize the show after Mitch's departure, Alex tries to leverage the situation to get all of her demands, including co-host approval. Cory, meanwhile, continues to use an unwitting Bradley to stir things up by getting her to come to an awards event honoring Alex, and seats the women next to each other. In the lobby, Cory scoffs when Alex demands co-host approval and calls her bluff when she threatens to leave the show. In retaliation, during her speech, Alex goes rogue and takes things into her own hands by announcing Bradley as her new co-host, much to the shock of everyone in attendance.</td></tr>

The staff of <i>The Morning Show</i> are in turmoil over the announcement.

Meanwhile, a frustrated Bradley has not even decided if she will accept the position. Mia Jordan asks Chip to make her Bradley's producer, and announces her new role before he has even offered it to her. Forced to go along with Alex's announcement or lose face, network president Fred Micklen is furious, but Cory reacts differently; he tells Fred to look at Bradley as an opportunity to reinvent the show and eventually be rid of Alex like they wanted. During Bradley's first camera tests, people question her initial wardrobe, and she challenges the copy Mia has provided her. Cory gets to know Bradley as they pick out a new wardrobe for her. Fred then summons Alex to browbeat her in front of a room of network executives, but she boldly informs him that he lost power over the show long ago, and from now on they will be doing things her way.</td></tr>

The networks have their annual advertising buy parties hosted by comediennes who make racist and homophobic jokes to the jeers of the audiences. Representatives from the lender inform Cory that since Q1 revenue is down 23% year to date and 48% of the revenue comes from advertising, UBA must match the previous year's ad buy or they won't underwrite the loan.

The website's critical consensus reads, "Flashy, but somewhat frivolous, <i>The Morning Show</i> often feels more like a vanity project than the hard-hitting drama it aspires to be—but there is pleasure to be had in watching Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon give it their all." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 61 out of 100 based on reviews from 37 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".</p>

<p>The second season of the series received a 67% from Rotten Tomatoes based on 51 reviews.

<p>The third season of the series received a 66% from Rotten Tomatoes based on 64 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, "Leaning into its soapier elements while bolstering an already star-studded cast with some welcome additions, <i>The Morning Show</i> upgrades from a shaky prestige program into an addictive guilty pleasure." At Metacritic, the website gave the third season a 65 out of 100, based on 30 reviews.</p>

<p>Richard Roeper of the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> gave a positive review and wrote: "<i>The Morning Show</i> doesn't have the cinematic gravitas of the Showtime series <i>The Loudest Voice</i> or the Aaron Sorkin poetry of HBO's <i>The Newsroom</i>. It's more along the lines of the solid but underachieving <i>Sports Night</i> TV series from the late 1990s."</p>

<h3>Audience viewership</h3>
<p>According to TV analytics provider TVision, <i>The Morning Show</i> has been viewed by panel members 5.03 times as much as the average Apple TV+ original series or shows TVision has measured since Apple TV+ launched in November 2019.
