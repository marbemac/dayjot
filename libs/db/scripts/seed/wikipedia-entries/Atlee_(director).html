<h2>Criticism</h2>
<p>Atlee's films, though commercially highly successful, have been criticized for having overly-familiar stories that have been done-to-death, starting from the 1980's of Tamil cinema. <i>Raja Rani</i> was described as an upgraded version of <i>Mouna Ragam</i> (1986), while <i>Theri</i> was described as inspired by <i>Chatriyan</i> (1990). <i>Mersal</i> was described as an upgraded version of <i>Apoorva Sagodharargal</i> (1989). <i>Bigil</i> was described as "<i>Chak De! India</i> (2007) on steroids". Atlee has countered that, despite having been sued for plagiarism numerous times, he has won all the cases against him.</p>



<h2>Personal life</h2>
<p>Atlee married actress Krishna Priya on 9 November 2014. Their son, Meer, was born on 31 January 2023.</p>
