<p>Costner was born on January 18, 1955, in Lynwood, California, and grew up in Compton, California. His parents were William and Sharon Costner. He is the youngest of three boys, the second of whom died at birth. Sharon Rae Costner (née Tedrick) was a welfare worker, and William Costner was an electrician and a utilities executive. Costner's father's heritage originates with German immigrants to North Carolina in the 1700s, and Costner also has English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh ancestry. Costner was raised Baptist. He was not academically inclined in school, but did play sports (especially football), take piano lessons, write poetry, and sing in the First Baptist Choir. He has said that watching the 1962 film <i>How the West Was Won</i> as a child inspired his love for Western films.</p>

<p>Costner has stated that he spent his teenage years in different parts of California as his father's career progressed. He has described this time as a period when he "lost a lot of confidence", having to make new friends often. Costner lived in Ventura, then in Visalia. Costner attended Mt. Whitney High School where he was in the marching band. Costner graduated from Villa Park High School in 1973. He played baseball at Villa Park and was teammates with Dennis Burtt. He earned a BA from California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) in 1978. While at CSUF, he became a brother in the Delta Chi fraternity.</p>

<p>Costner became interested in acting and dancing while in his last year of college. In 1978, while on an airplane returning from his honeymoon in Puerto Vallarta, Costner had a chance encounter with actor Richard Burton. At that time, Costner was uncertain about whether he should become an actor, and he approached Burton to ask his advice. Costner has said that Burton encouraged him to pursue acting. Costner has also stated that he asked Burton whether it was possible to be an actor without experiencing turmoil in one's private life; according to Costner, Burton replied that he thought it was possible. Costner credits Burton with inspiring him to become an actor.</p>

<p>Having agreed to undertake a job as a marketing executive, Costner began taking acting lessons five nights a week, with the support of his wife. His marketing job lasted 30 days. He took work which allowed him to develop his acting skills via tuition, including working on fishing boats, as a truck driver, and giving tours of stars' Hollywood homes to support the couple while he also attended auditions.</p>



<h2>Career</h2>
<h3>1981–1986: Rise to prominence</h3>
<p>Costner made his film debut in <i>Sizzle Beach, U.S.A.</i> (1981). Filmed in the winter of 1978–79, the film was not released until 1981 and re-released in 1986. The release complications and lack of documentation led many to believe that Costner's debut was in <i>The Touch</i> (also known as <i>Stacy's Knights</i>), in 1983 with Eve Lilith and Andra Millian. Costner played a minor role as "Frat Boy #1" in the Ron Howard film <i>Night Shift</i> (1982). He appears at the climax of a frat-style, blow-out party in the New York City morgue, when the music is suddenly stopped by a frantic Henry Winkler. Costner can be seen holding a beer and looking surprised at the sudden halt of celebration.</p>

<p>Costner appeared in a commercial for the Apple Lisa and <i>Table for Five</i> in 1983, and, the same year, had a small role in the nuclear holocaust film <i>Testament</i>. Later, he was cast in <i>The Big Chill</i> and filmed several scenes that were planned as flashbacks, but they were removed from the final cut. His role was that of Alex, the friend who committed suicide, the event that brings the rest of the cast together.  Costner was a friend of director Lawrence Kasdan, who promised the actor a role in a future project. That became <i>Silverado</i> (1985) and a breakout role for Costner. He also starred that year in the smaller films <i>Fandango</i> and <i>American Flyers</i> and appeared alongside Kiefer Sutherland in an hour-long special episode of Steven Spielberg's <i>Amazing Stories</i>.</p>

<h3>1987–1994: Stardom and acclaim</h3>

<p>Costner achieved movie star status in 1987, when he starred as federal agent Eliot Ness in <i>The Untouchables</i> and in the leading role of the thriller <i>No Way Out</i>. He solidified his A-list status in the baseball-themed films <i>Bull Durham</i> (1988) and <i>Field of Dreams</i> (1989). In 1990, he partnered with producer Jim Wilson to form the production company Tig Productions. Tig's first film was the epic <i>Dances with Wolves</i> which Costner directed and starred in. This film was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including two for him personally (Best Picture and Best Director). The same year saw the release of <i>Revenge</i>, in which he starred along with Anthony Quinn and Madeleine Stowe, directed by Tony Scott; Costner had wanted to direct it himself.</p>

<p>Costner portrayed Robin Hood in the action-adventure film <i>Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves</i> (1991) where he also served as a producer. Costner starred alongside Alan Rickman, Morgan Freeman, and Christian Slater. The film received mixed reviews but was an immense box-office success. He then starred as District Attorney Jim Garrison in the Oliver Stone-directed political epic thriller <i>JFK</i> (1991). The film gained significant controversy for its historical inaccuracies but was also praised for its style, direction, and performances. Costner received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama nomination for his role. Critic Roger Ebert praised his performance writing, "As Garrison, Costner gives a measured yet passionate performance. Like a man who has hold of an idea he cannot let go, he forges ahead, insisting that there is more to the assassination than meets the eye."</p>

<p>He then starred opposite Whitney Houston in the romantic drama <i>The Bodyguard</i> (1992) where he also served as a producer. The film was a pop-culture sensation and financial success. The next year he starred as a criminal on the run in Clint Eastwood's drama <i>A Perfect World</i> (1993). Film critic Owen Gleiberman of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> wrote, "Costner seems about as pathological as a koala bear, and his gentle charisma reinforces the film’s touchy-feely theme". He took the title role in the western biopic <i>Wyatt Earp</i> (1994), directed by Lawrence Kasdan, where he also served as a producer. That same year he starred in the drama film <i>The War</i>. The film also co-starred Elijah Wood. The film seemed to gain little attention.</p>

<p>The science fiction-post-apocalyptic epics <i>Waterworld</i> (1995) and <i>The Postman</i> (1997), the latter of which Costner also directed, were both commercial disappointments and both largely regarded by critics as artistic failures. However, while <i>Waterworld</i> achieved respectable box office and some positive reviews, results for <i>The Postman</i> were far worse and it ended up winning five Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Director for Costner. Costner starred in the golf comedy <i>Tin Cup</i> (1996) for Ron Shelton, who had previously directed him in <i>Bull Durham</i>. He developed the film <i>Air Force One</i> and was set to play the lead role of the President, but ultimately decided to concentrate on finishing <i>The Postman</i> instead. He personally offered the project to Harrison Ford. In 1999, he starred in <i>Message in a Bottle </i> with Robin Wright, based on the novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks. The film drew mixed reviews and just about broke even at the box office.</p>

<p>His career revived somewhat in 2000 with <i>Thirteen Days</i>, in which he portrayed Kenneth O'Donnell, a top adviser to John F. Kennedy. The western <i>Open Range</i>, which he directed and starred in, received critical acclaim in 2003, and was a surprise success commercially. He received some of his best reviews for his supporting role as retired professional baseball player Denny Davies in <i>The Upside of Anger</i>, for which he received a nomination from the Broadcast Film Critics Association and won the San Francisco Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. After that, Costner starred in <i>The Guardian</i> and in <i>Mr. Brooks</i>, in which he portrayed a serial killer.

In 2010, he appeared in <i>The Company Men</i> alongside Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper. It debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, and received good reviews. It was released in cinemas worldwide in January 2011. The film was considered to be an Oscar contender, but did not get a nomination.</p>

<p>Costner announced that he would be returning to the director's chair for the first time in seven years, in 2011, with <i>A Little War of Our Own</i>. He was also about to team up again with director Kevin Reynolds in <i>Learning Italian</i>. No updates have been released about either film since their original production announcement. He also appears, as a special cameo, in <i>Funny or Die</i>'s "Field of Dreams 2: NFL Lockout". Costner portrayed Jonathan Kent in the rebooted Superman film <i>Man of Steel</i>, directed by Zack Snyder.

<p>Costner is the singer in Kevin Costner &amp; Modern West, a country rock band which he founded with the encouragement of his wife Christine. In October 2007, they began a worldwide tour which included shows in Istanbul and Rome. The group also performed at NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races at Daytona International Speedway and Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina.</p>

<p>The band released a country album, <i>Untold Truths</i>, on November 11, 2008, on Universal South Records. The album peaked at No.61 on the <i>Billboard</i> Top Country Albums and No.35 on the Top Heatseekers chart. Three singles ("Superman 14", "Long Hot Night" and "Backyard") have been released to radio, although none have charted. For the single "Superman 14" a live music video was made.</p>

<p>In 2009, they went on tour with opening act The Alternate Routes. In August, at the Big Valley Jamboree in Camrose, Alberta, Costner and the band were scheduled next on stage when a severe thunderstorm struck, causing the stage and stands on the main stage to collapse. One person was reported dead and forty injured. Later, an auction was held to raise money for the two young sons of the woman killed. A dinner with Costner was auctioned off for $41,000. Two guitars, one autographed by Costner, helped raise another $10,000 each.</p>

<p>A second Kevin Costner and Modern West album, <i>Turn It On</i>, was released in February 2010 in Europe and was supported by a European tour. In July 2012, the band performed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the 20th annual Telus World Skins Game in support of the IWK Health Centre Foundation, donating a guitar autographed by Costner.</p>

<p>The most recent album released by Kevin Costner and Modern West, <i>Tales from Yellowstone</i>, was written by Costner and his co-writers from the perspective of John Dutton, Costner's character on the hit TV series <i>Yellowstone</i>.

<p>In 1995, Costner bought a company that was developing oil separation machines based on a patent he purchased from the US government. The machines developed by the company were of little commercial interest until the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, when BP took six of the machines from a company in which Costner owned an interest, Ocean Therapy Solutions, for testing in late May 2010. On June 16, 2010, BP entered into a lease with Ocean Therapy Solutions for 32 of the oil-water separation devices. Although Spyron Contoguris and Stephen Baldwin had previously sold their interests in Ocean Therapy Solutions in mid-June to another investor in the company, they filed a lawsuit in Louisiana District Court claiming $10.64million for securities fraud and misrepresentation. The suit claimed that Costner kept a meeting with BP secret from them, and the secret meeting resulted in an $18-million down payment on a $52million purchase, and that after the down payment, but before any announcement, another investor used part of the down payment to buy out their shares, thus excluding them from their share of the profits from the total sale. The suit claimed that, despite public statements by Costner, Ocean Therapy Solutions, BP and others to the contrary, Baldwin and Contogouris were told that BP was still testing the machines and had not yet committed to lease the machines from Ocean Therapy Solutions and that the other investor in Ocean Therapy Solutions purchased their shares for $1.4million to Baldwin and $500,000, to Contogouris. In June 2012, a federal jury in Louisiana deliberated for less than two hours before rejecting Baldwin's and Contogouris' claims in the multimillion-dollar oil-clean-up case, and the court ordered Baldwin and Contogouris to reimburse Costner and the other defendants in the case for their costs.</p>

<p>On June 6, 2004, Costner opened <i>Tatanka: The Story of the Bison</i> one mile south of Deadwood, South Dakota, on U.S. Route 85, saying he hoped it would be an educational and emotional place for people to learn about America's westward expansion. Promoters stated in a news release that the $5-million attraction had a new, 3,800-square-foot interactive center featuring exhibits, retail, and food and beverage areas, as well as offices and a small theater. The visitor center features graphics and text about the bison and the relationship of the Plains Indians to the animals - historically hunting and now raising them for food and clothing, among other things. The centerpiece is a bronze sculpture depicting a buffalo jump by Hill City artist Peggy Detmers, depicting 14 bronze bison in the act of running from their pursuers and three bronze Lakota riders on horseback. Three of the massive bison are posed in midair, cascading over the face of a cliff. Costner commissioned the work in 1994 from Detmers. The five-fourths-scale bronzes, each weighing between 2,500 and 8,000 pounds, were cast at Eagle Bronze Foundry in Lander, Wyoming.</p>

<p>Costner opened the Midnight Star Casino and Restaurant in Deadwood, S.D., in 1991. He hired Francis and Carla Caneva to manage the establishment and gave each of them a 3.25 percent ownership and paid them salaries and bonuses. He terminated their employment in July 2004 and asked to agree to an amicable disassociation. When they declined, Costner dissolved the partnership and hired an accountant who determined its fair market value to be $3.1 million. The Canevas sued Costner to buy their shares based on twice that amount or sell the company on the open market. They won in the lower court but, on Costner's appeal, lost in the South Dakota Supreme Court. Costner closed the establishment in 2017 and sold it in 2020.</p>

<p>In 2020, Costner joined Woody Sears's new audio entertainment travel app, HearHere, as a co-founder, podcast narrator, and investor. Costner narrates some of the audio stories provided by the iPhone subscription app for travelers on road trips across the United States who want to hear about the people, places, and histories they are encountering on their travels.</p>

<h3>Philanthropy</h3>
<p>Costner serves on an honorary board for the National World War I Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. In spring 2011, he recorded two radio spots for the museum that were aired on Kansas City Royals Radio Network.</p>

<h3>NASCAR</h3>
<p>Costner was named ceremonial Grand Marshal of the NASCAR Cup Series' Auto Club 500 which took place on February 25, 2007, at the California Speedway. In 2008, he worked with the NASCAR Media Group and CMT Films to help produce the NASCAR Documentary <i>The Ride of Their Lives</i> which was released in December of that year. Costner would be the narrator for that documentary. Also in 2009, he was named the spokesman for NASCAR Day which took place on May 15. The next day, May 16, he and his country music band would perform in the infield of Charlotte Motor Speedway as well as participate as a judge in the 2nd annual Victory Challenge before the 25th Running of the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race.</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>In 2015, Costner co-authored <i>The Explorer's Guild: A Passage to Shambhala</i>, a hybrid adventure novel and graphic novel, with John Baird, researcher Stephen C. Meyer, and illustrator Rick Ross.</p>

<p>Costner has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss' book <i>Tools of Titans</i>.</p>

During their marriage, they had two daughters born in 1984 and 1986, and a son born in 1988. The couple divorced in 1994 after 16 years of marriage, due to Costner allegedly having an affair while on the set of <i>Waterworld</i>. Cindy Silva received an $80 million settlement.</p>

<h3>Political activism</h3>
<p>Early in his life, Costner was a Republican. He was both a supporter and friend of Ronald Reagan, frequently playing golf with the former president. He eventually switched his affiliation in the early 1990s. Since 1992, Costner has financially supported a variety of Democratic politicians, including Al Gore and Tom Daschle, but also made contributions to Republican Phil Gramm as late as 1995.</p>

<p>In 2008, he said publicly that he had no ambition to run for political office, adding "I've lived quite a colorful life". In the final days before that year's United States presidential election, Costner campaigned for Barack Obama, visiting various places in Colorado, where he has a home. In his speech, Costner stated the need for young voters to get to the polls, early and with enthusiasm. "We were going to change the world and we haven't", Costner said at a Colorado State University rally. "My generation didn't get it done, and we need you to help us".</p>
