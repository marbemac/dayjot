<div>For the album, see <i>Taylor Swift</i> (album).</div>



<p><b>Taylor Alison Swift</b> (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Recognized for her songwriting, musical versatility, artistic reinventions, and influence on the music industry, she is a prominent cultural figure of the 21st century.</p>

<p>Swift began professional songwriting at age 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with her self-titled album in 2006. Her next, <i>Fearless</i> (2008), explored country pop, and its singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to prominence. <i>Speak Now</i> (2010) incorporated rock influences, while <i>Red</i> (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift's first <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". She departed from her country image with <i>1989</i> (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-flavored <i>Reputation</i> (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".</p>

<p>In 2018, Swift signed a new contract with Republic Records. She released the pop album <i>Lover</i> (2019) and autobiographical documentary <i>Miss Americana</i> (2020), embraced indie folk and alternative rock on her 2020 albums <i>Folklore</i> and <i>Evermore,</i> explored chill-out styles on <i>Midnights</i> (2022), and released four re-recorded versions of her first six albums as "Taylor's Versions" following a dispute with Big Machine. The albums and their number-one songs "Cruel Summer", "Cardigan", "Willow", "Anti-Hero" and "All Too Well" broke various records. In 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, her most expansive concert tour, and released the eponymous concert film. She has also directed music videos and films such as <i>All Too Well: The Short Film</i> (2021).</p>

<p>Having sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians, the most-streamed female artist on Spotify, and the only act to have five albums with first-week sales of over one million copies in the US. She has been featured in lists such as <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, <i>Billboard</i>'s Greatest of All Time Artists, the <i>Time</i> 100, and <i>Forbes</i> Celebrity 100. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards (including three Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 29 <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, 23 MTV Video Music Awards, three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards, and 101 <i>Guinness World Records</i>. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment.</p>

<p>Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania. Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), is a former homemaker who previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. She has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift, and their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, was an opera singer. Named after singer-songwriter James Taylor, Swift has Scottish, German and Italian heritage. She spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients. She is a Christian. She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, a Montessori school run by the Bernadine Franciscan sisters, before transferring to the Wyndcroft School. The family moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School. She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee shop.</p>

<p>At age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her "want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything." She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music. She traveled there with her mother at age eleven to visit record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and the Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. She was rejected, however, because "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different."</p>

<p>When Swift was around 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. "Kiss Me" by Sixpence None the Richer was the first song Swift learned to play. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write "Lucky You". In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York–based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch as part of their "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels. After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother. To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee. Swift initially attended Hendersonville High School before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.</p>

<h3>2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album</h3>
<p>In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose called the sessions "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks." Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left the Sony-owned RCA Records at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them "cut[ting] other people's stuff". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists and recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through."</p>

To promote her first album, she opened tours for other country musicians in 2007 and 2008.
<p>At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004. She was one of Big Machine's first signings, and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000. She began working on her eponymous debut album with producer Nathan Chapman, with whom she felt she had the right "chemistry". Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone and co-wrote the remaining eight with Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia. <i>Taylor Swift</i> was released on October 24, 2006. <i>Country Weekly</i> critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her "honesty, intelligence and idealism". The album peaked at number five on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the U.S. in the 2000s decade. Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a U.S. platinum-certified debut album.</p>

<p>Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, "Tim McGraw", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so. She spent much of 2006 promoting <i>Taylor Swift</i> with a radio tour, television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour, as a replacement for Eric Church. Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.</p>

<p>Following "Tim McGraw", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn" and "Should've Said No". All appeared on <i>Billboard</i>'s Hot Country Songs, with "Our Song" and "Should've Said No" reaching number one. With "Our Song", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart. "Teardrops on My Guitar" reached number thirteen on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Swift also released two EPs, <i>The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection</i> in October 2007 and <i>Beautiful Eyes</i> in July 2008. She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait, Brad Paisley, and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.</p>

<p>Swift won multiple accolades for <i>Taylor Swift</i>. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person to be honored with the title. She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist, the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist, and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor. She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards. In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again, and dated singer Joe Jonas briefly.</p>

<h3>2008–2010: <i>Fearless</i> and acting debut</h3>

She had a cameo appearance in the film and wrote two songs for its soundtrack.
<p>Swift's second studio album, <i>Fearless</i>, was released on November 11, 2008, in North America, and in March 2009 in other markets. Critics lauded Swift's honest and vulnerable songwriting in contrast to other teenage singers. Five singles were released in 2008–2009: "Love Story", "White Horse", "You Belong with Me", "Fifteen", and "Fearless". The first single peaked at number four on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and number one in Australia. It was the first country song to top <i>Billboard</i>'s Pop Songs chart. "You Belong with Me" was the album's highest-charting single on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, peaking at number two, and was the first country song to top <i>Billboard</i>'s all-genre Radio Songs chart. All five singles were Hot Country Songs top-10 entries, with "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" topping the chart. <i>Fearless</i> became her first number-one album on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and 2009's top-selling album in the U.S. The Fearless Tour, Swift's first headlining concert tour, grossed over $63million. <i>Journey to Fearless</i>, a documentary miniseries, aired on television and was later released on DVD and Blu-ray. Swift also performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban's Escape Together World Tour in 2009.</p>

<p>In 2009, the music video for "You Belong with Me" was named Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West, an incident that became the subject of controversy, widespread media attention and Internet memes. That year she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album. <i>Billboard</i> named her 2009's Artist of the Year. She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for "Love Story" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called "Thug Story". At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, <i>Fearless</i> was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and "White Horse" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Swift was the youngest artist to win Album of the Year. At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for <i>Fearless</i> and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.</p>

<p>Swift featured on John Mayer's single "Half of My Heart" and Boys Like Girls' "Two Is Better Than One", the latter of which she co-wrote. She co-wrote and recorded "Best Days of Your Life" with Kellie Pickler, and wrote two songs for the <i>Hannah Montana: The Movie</i> soundtrack—"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home" and "Crazier". She contributed two songs to the <i>Valentine's Day</i> soundtrack, including the single "Today Was a Fairytale", which was her first number-one on the Canadian Hot 100 and peaked at number two on the U.S. Hot 100. While shooting her film debut <i>Valentine's Day</i> in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner. In 2009, she made her television debut as a rebellious teenager in an <i>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</i> episode. She hosted and performed as the musical guest on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>; she was the first host ever to write their own opening monologue.</p>

Swift wrote the album alone and co-produced every track. It was released on October 25, 2010, opening atop the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with over one million copies sold. It became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist, with 278,000 downloads in a week. Critics appreciated Swift's grown-up perspectives; Rob Sheffield of <i>Rolling Stone</i> wrote, "in a mere four years, the 20-year-old Nashville firecracker has put her name on three dozen or so of the smartest songs released by anyone in pop, rock or country." "Back to December", "Mean", "The Story of Us", "Sparks Fly", and "Ours" became subsequent singles, with the latter two reaching number one on the Hot Country Songs and the first two peaking in the top ten in Canada. She dated actor Jake Gyllenhaal in 2010.</p>

<p>At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Swift won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance for "Mean", which she performed during the ceremony.

<p>In March 2014, Swift began living in New York City. She hired Tree Paine as her publicist, and worked on her fifth studio album, <i>1989</i>, with producers Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami. She promoted the album extensively, including inviting fans to secret album-listening sessions. <i>1989</i> was released on October 27, 2014, and opened atop the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with 1.28million copies sold.

The 1989 World Tour (2015) was the highest-grossing tour of the year with $250million in total revenue.</p>

<p>Prior to <i>1989</i>'s release, Swift stressed the importance of albums to artists and fans. In November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that the streaming company's ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters. In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull <i>1989</i> from the catalog. The following day, Apple Inc. announced that it would pay artists during the free trial period, and Swift agreed to let <i>1989</i> on the streaming service. She then returned her entire catalog plus <i>1989</i> to Spotify, Amazon Music and Google Play and other digital streaming platforms in June 2017. Swift was named <i>Billboard</i>'s Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice. At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence. On her 25th birthday in 2014, the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live opened an exhibit in her honor in Los Angeles that ran until October 4, 2015, and broke museum attendance records. In 2015, Swift won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist. The video for "Bad Blood" won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards. At the 58th Grammy Awards (2016), <i>1989</i> won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, making Swift the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice.</p>

<p>Swift dated Scottish DJ Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016. They co-wrote the song "This Is What You Came For", featuring vocals from Barbadian singer Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg. In April 2016, Swift criticized the lyrics of West's single "Famous", in which he sings "I made that bitch famous" in reference to his interruption of her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. West claimed he had received her approval for the line, and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the single amicably over the phone; a full recording of the call leaked in 2020 established that West did not disclose that he would call her a bitch.</p>

<p>After briefly dating English actor Tom Hiddleston, Swift entered a six-year relationship with English actor Joe Alwyn in September 2016. She wrote the song "Better Man" for country band Little Big Town, which earned her the Song of the Year award at the 51st CMA Awards. Swift and English singer Zayn Malik released the joint single "I Don't Wanna Live Forever" for <i>Fifty Shades Darker: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</i> (2017). The song reached number two in the U.S. In August 2017, Swift successfully countersued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from his loss of employment. Four years earlier, she informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event.</p>

<p>After a one-year hiatus from public spotlight, Swift cleared her social media accounts and released "Look What You Made Me Do" as the lead single from her sixth album, <i>Reputation</i>. The single was Swift's first U.K. number-one single. It topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.S. <i>Reputation</i>, released on November 10, 2017, incorporated heavy electropop, along with hip hop, R&amp;B, and EDM sounds. Reviews praised Swift's mature artistry, but some denounced the themes of fame and gossip. The album opened atop the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with 1.21million sales, making Swift the first act to have four albums sell one million copies in a week in the U.S. The album topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada, and sold over 4.5million copies worldwide as of 2018. It spawned three more singles: "...Ready for It?", "End Game" (featuring Ed Sheeran and rapper Future) and "Delicate". <i>Reputation</i> was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in 2019. At the American Music Awards of 2018, Swift won four awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist. Swift had garnered collected 23 AMAs in her career, becoming the most awarded female musician in the show, surpassing Whitney Houston. In April 2018, Swift featured on country duo Sugarland's "Babe". She embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour in 2018. It broke many records, such as the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history with $345.7million revenue worldwide. It was followed up with an accompanying concert film on Netflix.</p>

<p><i>Reputation</i> was Swift's last album under Big Machine. In November 2018, she signed a new deal with the Universal Music Group; her subsequent releases were promoted by Republic Records. Swift said the contract included a provision for her to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists. <i>Vox</i> called it a huge commitment from Universal, which was "far from assured" until Swift intervened.</p>

<p>Swift released her seventh studio album, <i>Lover</i>, on August 23, 2019. Besides Jack Antonoff, Swift worked with new producers Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little. <i>Lover</i> made Swift the first female artist to have a sixth consecutive album sell more than 500,000 copies in one week in the U.S. Critics commended the album's free-spirited mood and emotional intimacy. The lead single, "Me!", peaked at number two on the Hot 100. Other singles from <i>Lover</i> were the U.S. top 10 singles "You Need to Calm Down" and "Lover", top 40 single "The Man", and "Cruel Summer", which became a resurgent success in 2023 and reached number one on the Hot 100. <i>Lover</i> was the world's best-selling album by a solo artist of 2019, selling 3.2million copies, and along with its singles earned nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020. At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, "Me!" won Best Visual Effects, and "You Need to Calm Down" won Video of the Year and Video for Good. Swift was the first female and second artist overall to win Video of the Year for a video that they directed.</p>

<p>While promoting <i>Lover</i>, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and Big Machine over the purchase of the masters of her back catalog. Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would only allow her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under new contract, which she refused to sign. Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020. Besides music, she played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical <i>Cats</i> (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song "Beautiful Ghosts". Critics panned the film but praised Swift's performance. The documentary <i>Miss Americana</i>, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and was released on Netflix that January. Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group in February 2020 after her 16-year-old contract with Sony/ATV expired.</p>

<p>Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift released two surprise albums: <i>Folklore</i> on July 24, and <i>Evermore</i> on December 11, 2020. Both explore indie folk and alternative rock with a more muted production compared to her previous upbeat pop songs. Swift wrote and recorded the albums with producers Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner from the National. Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced select songs under the pseudonym William Bowery. The albums garnered widespread critical acclaim. <i>The Guardian</i> and <i>Vox</i> opined that <i>Folklore</i> and <i>Evermore</i> emphasized Swift's work ethic and increased her artistic credibility. Three singles supported each of the albums, catering the U.S. mainstream radio, country radio, and triple A radio. The singles, in that order, were "Cardigan", "Betty", and "Exile" from <i>Folklore</i>, and "Willow", "No Body, No Crime", and "Coney Island" from <i>Evermore</i>. Swift became the first artist to debut a U.S. number-one album and a number-one song at the same time with <i>Folklore</i>'s "Cardigan" and <i>Evermore</i>'s "Willow". <i>Folklore</i> was 2020's best-selling album in the U.S. with 1.2million copies. It won Album of the Year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making Swift the first woman to win the award thrice. At the 2020 American Music Awards, she won three awards, including Artist of the Year for a record third consecutive time. According to <i>Billboard</i>, she was 2020's highest-paid musician in the U.S., and the world's highest-paid solo musician.</p>

<p>Following the masters dispute, Swift released three re-recorded albums—<i>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</i> and <i>Red (Taylor's Version)</i> in 2021 and <i>Speak Now (Taylor's Version)</i> in 2023. All three peaked atop the <i>Billboard</i> 200, becoming the first ever re-recorded albums to do so. <i>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</i> was preceded by "Love Story (Taylor's Version)", the re-recording of Swift's 2008 single, which made her the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on the Hot Country Songs chart. <i>Red (Taylor's Version)</i> was supported by "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot 100. The song was accompanied by a short film, which won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video and Swift's record third MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year. Her fourth re-recorded album, <i>1989 (Taylor's Version)</i>, will be released on October 27, 2023. The album was preceded by two re-recorded songs, "Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)" and "This Love (Taylor's Version)".</p>

<p>Amidst the re-recording projects, Swift's tenth studio album, <i>Midnights</i>, was released on October 21, 2022. It experiments with chill-out music and received critical acclaim, with <i>Rolling Stone</i> critics dubbing it an instant classic. It was Swift's fifth album to open atop the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies and broke various sales and streaming records, including the most U.S. first-week vinyl sales and the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify. Its tracks, led by the single "Anti-Hero", monopolized the entire top 10 of the Hot 100, making Swift the first artist to do so. Two other singles, "Lavender Haze" and "Karma", both peaked at number two on the Hot 100. To support <i>Midnights</i> and all of her albums to date, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour in March 2023. Media outlets extensively covered the tour's cultural and economic impact, and its U.S. leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day. Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling ticket sales and alleged monopoly in the concert industry. A concert film of the tour, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, became the highest-grossing concert film ever. Swift won nine awards at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year ("Anti-Hero") for a record fourth time.</p>

<p>Beyond her albums, Swift featured on five songs from 2021 to 2023: "Renegade" and "Birch" by Big Red Machine, a remix of "Gasoline" by Haim, "The Joker and the Queen" by Ed Sheeran, and "The Alcott" by the National. For the soundtrack of the 2022 film <i>Where the Crawdads Sing</i>, she recorded "Carolina", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards<i>.</i> Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity post-pandemic. Music Business Worldwide remarked that she entered a "new stratosphere of global career success". Swift received the Songwriter Icon Award from the National Music Publishers' Association. Outside of music, she had a bit part in the 2022 period comedy <i>Amsterdam</i> and has ventured into directing a feature film under Searchlight Pictures.</p>



<h2>Artistry</h2>
<h3>Influences</h3>
<p>One of Swift's earliest memories of music is listening to her grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church. As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: "My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own." Swift said she owes her confidence and "fascination with writing and storytelling" to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.</p> 

<p>Swift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music, introduced to the genre by "the great female country artists" of the 1990s—Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks. Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence. Hill was Swift's childhood role model, as she would often imitate her. She admired the Chicks' defiant attitude and ability to play their own instruments, and was also influenced by older country stars like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton, the last of whom she believes is exemplary to female songwriters. As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by Joni Mitchell's emotional and autobiographical lyrics, highlighting Mitchell's album <i>Blue</i> as a favorite "because it explores somebody's soul so deeply." She also spoke of influence from 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan and Alanis Morissette, and alt-country artists like Patty Griffin and Lori McKenna.</p>

<p>Various pop and rock artists have also influenced Swift. She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as her career role models. <i>1989</i> was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna. She also cited Keith Urban's musical style and Fall Out Boy's lyrics as major influences.</p>

<h3>Genres</h3>
<div>

<blockquote>
<p>"If there's one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it's that she refuses to be put in a box. Her ever-evolving sound took her from country darling to pop phenom to folk's newest raconteur."</p>

<p>Swift is known for venturing into various music genres and undergoing artistic reinventions, having been described as a "music chameleon". She self-identified as a country musician until 2012, when she released her fourth studio album, <i>Red</i>. Her albums were promoted to country radio, but music critics noted wide-ranging styles of pop and rock. After 2010, they observed that Swift's melodies are rooted in pop music, and the country music elements are limited to instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and fiddle, and her slight twang; some commented that her country music identity was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical style. Although the Nashville music industry was receptive of Swift's status as a country musician, critics accused her of abandoning her roots in favor of crossover success in the mainstream pop market. <i>Red</i>'s eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles intensified the critical debate, to which Swift responded, "I leave the genre labeling to other people."</p>

<p>Music journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her musical career in Nashville, Swift made a "bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop". She abandoned her country music identity in 2014 with the release of her synth-pop fifth studio album, <i>1989</i>. Swift described it as her first "documented, official pop album". Her subsequent albums <i>Reputation</i> (2017) and <i>Lover</i> (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop, trap, and EDM elements. <i>Midnights</i> (2022), on the other hand, is distinguished by a more experimental, "subdued and amorphous pop sound". Although reviews of Swift's pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift's pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background—a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist. Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift's pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry. Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative, folk and indie rock styles with her 2020 studio albums <i>Folklore</i> and <i>Evermore</i>. <i>Clash</i> said her career "has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing", reaching a point at which "Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift", not defined by any genre.</p>

<p>Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range, and a generally soft but versatile timbre. As a country singer, her vocals were criticized by some as weak and strained compared to those of her contemporaries. Swift admitted her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career and has worked hard to improve. Reviews of her vocals remained mixed after she transitioned to pop music with <i>1989</i>; critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing "intimacy over power and nuance". They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.</p>

<p>The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> remarked that Swift's defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow". With <i>Reputation</i>, critics noted she was "learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own", swapping her "signature" expressive vocals for "cool, conversational, detached" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&amp;B styles. <i>Alternative Press</i> stated that her "evocative" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.</p>

<p>Reviews of Swift's later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful. With <i>Folklore</i> and <i>Evermore</i>, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice. <i>Pitchfork</i> described it as "versatile and expressive". With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and "fuller" tone of her voice. An <i>i</i> review said Swift's voice is "leagues better now" with her newfound vocal furniture. <i>The Guardian</i> highlighted "yo-yoing vocal yelps" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift's voice, and that her country twang faded away. <i>Midnights</i> received acclaim for Swift's nuanced vocal delivery. She ranked 102nd on the 2023 <i>Rolling Stone</i> list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. In a review of the Eras Tour, <i>The New Yorker</i> critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals.</p>

<h3>Songwriting</h3>
<div>Further information: List of songs by Taylor Swift</div>
<p>Swift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters of all time by several publications. English-language scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and verbal writing style are rare amongst her peers. Swift's bridges are often underscored as one of the best aspects of her songs, earning her the title "Queen of Bridges" from <i>Time</i>. <i>Mojo</i> described her as "a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor".</p>

<p>In <i>The New Yorker</i> in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: "I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across". Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life. Her "diaristic" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody. On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes. She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on <i>Red</i>, and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on <i>1989</i>. <i>Reputation</i> was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame, and <i>Lover</i> detailed her realization of the "full spectrum of love". Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship, alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.</p>

<p>Her confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics, who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music. Critics also praised her melodic compositions; <i>Rolling Stone</i> described Swift as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture". NPR dubbed Swift "a master of the vernacular in her lyrics", remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because "the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures". Despite the positive reception, <i>The New Yorker</i> stated she was generally portrayed "more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary". Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist. Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.</p>

<p>On her 2020 albums <i>Folklore</i> and <i>Evermore</i>, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives. Without referencing her personal life, she imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry. Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success. According to <i>Spin</i>, she explored complex emotions with "precision and devastation" on <i>Evermore</i>. <i>Consequence</i> stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from "teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult".</p>

<p>Swift divides her writing into three types: "quill lyrics", referring to songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; "fountain pen lyrics", based on modern and vivid storylines; and "glitter gel pen lyrics", which are lively and frivolous. Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most "emotionally vulnerable" song of the album. Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that "no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today" than Swift. <i>The Week</i> deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times, and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022. Swift has also published two original poems: "Why She Disappeared" and "If You're Anything Like Me".</p>

A review in <i>Stereogum</i> said, Swift's onstage persona emulates those of "classic rock deities".
<p>Journalists have described Swift as one of the best performers and entertainers in mainstream music. Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence, Swift is known for her ability to command large audiences, such as in a stadium, without having to rely fully on dance like her contemporaries do. According to <i>V</i> magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses "a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting", irrespective of whethere she is "plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers".</p>

<p>In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of <i>The New Yorker</i> called Swift a "preternaturally skilled" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding "she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen." In 2023, Adrian Horton of <i>The Guardian</i> noted her "seemingly endless stamina" on the Eras Tour, and <i>i</i> critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship "unparalleled".</p>

<p>Critics have highlighted Swift's versatility as an entertainer, praising her ability to switch onstage personas and performance styles depending on the varying themes and aesthetics of her albums. Her concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology, and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007. Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, and sometimes a banjo or ukulele. Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection. Lydia Burgham of <i>The Spinoff</i> opined that this intimacy remains "integral to her singer-songwriter origins". Chris Willman of <i>Variety</i> called Swift "pop's most approachable superstar", and the 21st century's most popular performer.</p>

<h3>Video and film</h3>
<div>Further information: Taylor Swift videography</div>
<p>Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music making process. She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for "Mean" in 2011 and co-directed the music video for "Mine" with Roman White the year before. In an interview, White said that Swift "was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes."</p>

<p>From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums <i>1989</i> and <i>Reputation</i>. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement in the craft. She worked with American Express for the "Blank Space" music video (which Kahn directed), and served as an executive producer for the interactive app <i>AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience</i>, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015. Swift produced the music video for "Bad Blood" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.</p>

<p>Her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media starting with the 2018 concert documentary <i>Reputation Stadium Tour</i>. She continued to co-direct music videos for the <i>Lover</i> singles "Me!" with Dave Meyers, and "You Need to Calm Down" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and "Lover" with Drew Kirsch, but first ventured into sole direction with the video for "The Man" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction). After <i>Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions</i>, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with <i>All Too Well: The Short Film</i>, which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director. Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as her filmmaking influences.</p>

<p>Swift has made a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture, economy and beyond. She dominates cultural conversations, and hence publications describe her as a cultural "vitality" or zeitgeist. <i>Billboard</i> noted only few artists have had her chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support, resulting in a wide impact. Swift's million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s. She is the only artist in Luminate Data history to have five albums sell over a million copies in a week, leading <i>New York</i> magazine to call her "the one bending the music industry to her will". Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an "economic genius".</p>

<p>In 2013, <i>New York</i> magazine's Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the "world's biggest pop star", and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift "falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends", leaving all the other artists "vying for second place". According to CNN, Swift began the 2010s decade as a country star and ended it as an "all-time musical titan". She was the most googled woman in 2019 and musician in 2022. Her fanbase is known as the Swifties.</p>

<h3>Legacy</h3>
<div>

<blockquote>
<p>"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we're at this moment where there's no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that's on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– Jason Lipshutz, <i>Billboard</i> executive director</p>
</div><p>Swift helped shape the modern country music scene, having extended her success and fame beyond the Anglosphere, pioneered the use of internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool, and introduced the genre to a younger generation. Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music; her guitar performances contributed to the "Taylor Swift factor", a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.</p>

<p>According to publications, Swift changed the music landscape "forever" with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts, and her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music. Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same. Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift in the 21st century. She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album "eras".</p>

<p>Swift has influenced numerous music artists, and her albums have inspired an entire generation of singer-songwriters. Journalists praise her ability to reform industry practices, noting how her actions changed streaming policies, prompted awareness of intellectual property in new musicians, and reshaped ticketing models. Various sources deem Swift's music a paradigm representing the millennial generation; <i>Vox</i> called her the "millennial Bruce Springsteen", and <i>The Times</i> named her "the Bob Dylan of our age". Swift earned the title Woman of the Decade (2010s) from <i>Billboard</i>, Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards, and Global Icon at the Brit Awards for her impact. Senior artists such as Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Madonna, and Parton have praised her musicianship. Carole King regards Swift her "professional grand daughter" and thanked Swift for "carrying the torch forward". Springsteen called her a "tremendous" writer, while Ringo Starr and Billy Joel considered Swift the Beatles' successor.</p>

<p>Swift is a subject of academic study and scholarly media research. Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural and sociopolitical contexts. Entomologists named a millipede species <i>Nannaria swiftae</i> in her honor<i>.</i></p>

<h3>Public image</h3>
<p>Swift's music, life and image are points of attention in global celebrity culture. Initially a teen idol, she has become a dominant figure in popular culture, often referred to as a pop icon. Publications note her immense popularity and longevity as the kind of fame unwitnessed since the 20th century. Music critics Sam Sanders and Ann Powers regard Swift as a "surprisingly successful composite of megawatt pop star and bedroom singer-songwriter."</p>

<p>Journalists have written about Swift's polite and "open" personality, calling her a "media darling" and "a reporter's dream". Awarding her for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, former First Lady Michelle Obama described Swift as an artist who "has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish". Swift, labeled by the media in her early career as "America's Sweetheart" for her likability and girl-next-door image, has earned a reputation for her enthusiasm at award shows. YouGov surveys ranked her as the world's most admired female musician from 2019 to 2021.</p> 

<p>Though Swift is reluctant to publicly discuss her personal life, believing it to be "a career weakness", it is a topic of widespread media attention and tabloid speculation, with all her moves "closely monitored and analyzed." <i>Clash</i> described Swift as a lightning rod for criticism. <i>The New York Times</i> asserted in 2013 that her "dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash" and questioned whether she was in the midst of a "quarter-life crisis". Swift's detractors accused her of being "calculated" and manipulating her image—a narrative bolstered after the 2016 dispute with West. Cultural critics have highlighted that Swift's life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and slut-shaming, and she is an easy target of "fragile male egos", hence her antennae for sexism are crucial for the industry. Swift has also been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.</p>

<p>Having embraced the cat lady archetype, Swift owns three cats; Meredith Grey, Olivia Benson, and Benjamin Button. They have been featured or referenced in her videos and other works.</p>

<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p>Media outlets describe Swift as a savvy businesswoman. She is also known for her traditional album rollouts, consisting of a variety of promotional activities that <i>Rolling Stone</i> termed as an inescapable "multimedia bonanza".

Swift performed during WorldPride NYC 2019 at the Stonewall Inn, a gay rights monument. She has donated to the LGBT organizations Tennessee Equality Project and GLAAD.</p>
