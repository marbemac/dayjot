<p>Drew Blythe Barrymore was born on February 22, 1975, in Culver City, California, to actor John Drew Barrymore and aspiring actress Jaid Barrymore (born Ildikó Jaid Makó), who was born in a displaced persons camp in Brannenburg, West Germany, to Hungarian World War II refugees. Through her father, Barrymore has three older half-siblings, including actor John Blyth Barrymore. Her parents divorced in 1984.</p>

<p>In 2023, Barrymore displayed an AncestryDNA test onscreen on her talk show, which showed that her genetic ancestry is primarily European, with 6% Northern Indian.</p>

<p>Barrymore was born into an acting family. All of her paternal great-grandparents, Maurice and Georgie Drew Barrymore, Maurice and Mae Costello (née Altschuk), and her paternal grandparents, John Barrymore and Dolores Costello, were actors, with John being arguably the most acclaimed actor of his generation. Barrymore is a niece of Diana Barrymore, a grandniece of Lionel Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore and Helene Costello, and a great-great-granddaughter of Irish-born John and English-born Louisa Lane Drew, all of whom were also actors. She is a great grandniece of Broadway idol John Drew Jr. and silent film actor, writer and director Sidney Drew.</p>

<p>Barrymore's godmothers are actress Sophia Loren and Lee Strasberg's widow, Anna Strasberg; Barrymore described her relationship with the latter as one that "would become so important to me as a kid because she was so kind and nurturing." Her godfather is filmmaker Steven Spielberg.</p>

<p>Barrymore's first name, Drew, was the maiden name of her paternal great-grandmother Georgie Drew, and her middle name, Blythe, was the surname of the family first used by her great-grandfather Maurice Barrymore. In her 1991 autobiography <i>Little Girl Lost</i>, Barrymore recounted early memories of her abusive father, who left the family when she was six months old. She and her father never had a significant relationship and seldom spoke.</p>

<h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>Barrymore grew up on Poinsettia Place in West Hollywood, until she moved to Sherman Oaks at the age of seven. In her 2015 memoir <i>Wildflower</i>, she says she spoke "like a valley girl" because she grew up in Sherman Oaks. She moved back to West Hollywood on becoming emancipated at age 14. She attended elementary school at Fountain Day School in West Hollywood and Country School. In the wake of her sudden stardom, Barrymore endured a notoriously troubled childhood. She was a regular at Studio 54 as a young girl, and her nightlife and constant partying became a popular subject with the media. She was placed in rehab at 13, and spent 18 months in an institution for the mentally ill. A suicide attempt at 14 put her back in rehab, followed by a three-month stay with singer David Crosby and his wife. The stay was precipitated, Crosby said, because she "needed to be around some people that were committed to sobriety." Barrymore described this period of her life for <i>Little Girl Lost.</i> After a successful juvenile court petition for emancipation, she moved into her own apartment at the age of 15.</p>

<p>Barrymore's career began when she was eleven months old, when she appeared in a dog food commercial. After her film debut with a small role in <i>Altered States</i>, she played Gertie in <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i>. Director Steven Spielberg felt she had the right imagination for the role after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band. <i>E.T.</i> was the highest-grossing film of the 1980s, and made Barrymore one of the most famous child actors of the time. She won the Young Artist Award for Best Young Supporting Actress and was nominated for the Rising Star Award at the British Academy Film Awards. In the eighth season of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, she became the youngest person to guest-host the series.</p>

<p>In the 1984 horror film adaptation for Stephen King's 1980 novel <i>Firestarter</i>, Barrymore played a girl with pyrokinesis who became the target of a secret government agency known as The Shop. That year, she also played a young girl divorcing her famous parents in <i>Irreconcilable Differences</i>, and was nominated for her first Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. In his review in the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, Roger Ebert wrote: "Barrymore is the right actress for this role precisely because she approaches it with such grave calm."</p>

<p>Barrymore endured a troubled youth and continued acting during the decade. She starred in the anthology horror film <i>Cat's Eye,</i> also written by King. It received positive reviews and Barrymore was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Leading Young Actress. She was offered the role of Cecile for <i>Dangerous Liaisons</i>, but it went to Uma Thurman. Barrymore starred in the romance film <i>See You in the Morning</i>. Vincent Canby of <i>The New York Times</i> criticized the "fashionable phoniness" of the film, but positively singled out Barrymore. In <i>Far from Home</i>, she played a teenager who gets stranded with her father in a small, remote desert town. The film went largely unnoticed by audiences and received negative reviews from critics, who dismissed the sexual portrayal of her role.</p>

<h3>1990s</h3>
<p>Barrymore's rebelliousness played itself out on screen and in print. She played a poor teenage girl in <i>Poison Ivy</i>, which was a box-office bomb, but was popular on video and cable. Her character "Ivy" was ranked at #6 on the list of the top 26 "bad girls" of all time by <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>. Barrymore was seventeen when she posed nude with her then-fiancé, actor Jamie Walters, for the cover of the July issue of <i>Interview</i> magazine; she also appeared nude in pictures inside the issue.</p>

<p>In <i>Guncrazy</i>, Barrymore played a teenager who kills her abusive stepfather. <i>Variety</i> remarked that she "pulls off impressively" her character, and Barrymore was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film. Barrymore played the younger sister of a murdered ballerina in <i>No Place to Hide</i> and a writer followed by what is apparently her evil twin in <i>Doppelganger</i>. Both films were panned by critics and failed to find an audience. She appeared in the western film <i>Bad Girls</i>, which follows four former prostitutes on the run following a justifiable homicide and prison escape. Roger Ebert, in his review for the film, wrote for <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>: "What a good idea, to make a Western about four tough women. And what a sad movie."</p>

<p>Barrymore posed nude for the January 1995 issue of <i>Playboy</i>. Soon after, her godfather Steven Spielberg gave her a quilt for her 20th birthday with a note that read, "Cover yourself up." Enclosed in the quilt were copies of her <i>Playboy</i> pictures which had been altered by Spielberg's art department so that she appeared fully clothed. Barrymore later said that she would not let her own child make the same choice she did.</p>

<p>While appearing on the <i>Late Show with David Letterman</i>, Barrymore climbed onto the desk, flashed her breasts to David Letterman and gave him a kiss on the cheek as a birthday gift. She modeled in a series of Guess? jeans ads during this time.</p>

<p>In the late 1990s, Barrymore re-established her image and continued to be a highly bankable star.</p>

<p>In <i>Boys on the Side</i>, Barrymore played a pregnant girl attempting to escape from her abusive boyfriend. It was a box office success and was positively received by critics. In the superhero film <i>Batman Forever</i>, she played one of the two female assistants for Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones).</p> 

<p>Barrymore made a brief but notable appearance in Wes Craven's 1996 slasher film <i>Scream</i>. She read the film's script and was interested in being involved, approaching the production team herself to request a role. The producers were quick to take advantage of her unexpected interest and signed her to play the lead role of Sidney Prescott. However, after unexpected commitments, Barrymore played Casey Becker in a minor role, and Neve Campbell took the leading one. <i>Scream</i> was released to critical acclaim and made $173 million worldwide.</p> 

<p>In <i>The Wedding Singer</i> (1998), Barrymore played a waitress in love with the titular character, played by Adam Sandler. <i>Variety</i> found the film to be a "spirited, funny and warm saga" that serves them up "in a new way that enhances their most winning qualities". Budgeted at $18 million, the film grossed $123.3 million internationally. In <i>Home Fries</i> (1998), Barrymore played a pregnant woman unknowingly falling for the stepson of the late father of her baby. She starred in the historical drama film <i>Ever After</i> (1998), which made $98 million and was inspired by the fairy tale Cinderella. Roger Ebert said about Barrymore and the film: "she can hold the screen and involve us in her characters".</p>

<p>Barrymore voiced an anthropomorphic Jack Russell terrier in the Christmas television film <i>Olive, the Other Reindeer</i> and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. After establishing Flower Films, Barrymore and Nancy Juvonen produced the company's first film, <i>Never Been Kissed</i>, in which Barrymore played an insecure copy editor for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> and a high school student. While reviews from critics were mixed, <i>CNN</i> noted: "There are two words which describe why this film works: Drew Barrymore. Her comedic timing and willingness to go all out in her quest for a laugh combine to make <i>Never Been Kissed</i> a gratifying movie-going experience". The film was a commercial success, grossing $84.5 million.</p>

<p>In <i>Charlie's Angels</i>, Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu played the trio of investigators in Los Angeles. The film was a major box office success and helped solidify Barrymore's standing in her production company as one of the film's producers. Barrymore starred in <i>Riding in Cars with Boys</i>, as a teenage mother in a failed marriage with the drug-addicted father (based on Beverly Donofrio's real-life story). When the production of <i>Donnie Darko</i> was threatened, Barrymore stepped forward with financing from the company, and played the title character's English teacher. Although the film was less than successful at the box office in the wake of 9/11, it reached cult status after the DVD release, inspiring numerous websites devoted to unraveling the plot twists and meanings.</p>

<p>Barrymore starred in George Clooney's directorial debut <i>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</i>, based on the autobiography of television producer Chuck Barris. Barrymore reprised her role in <i>Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle</i> and starred with Ben Stiller in <i>Duplex</i>. Flower Films and Happy Madison Productions produced the film <i>50 First Dates</i>, in which Barrymore played an amnesiac woman and Sandler played a marine veterinarian. Summing up Barrymore's appeal, Roger Ebert, in his review for the film, remarked that Barrymore displayed a "smiling, coy sincerity", in what he described as an "ingratiating and lovable" film. <i>50 First Dates</i> was a commercial success; it made US$120.9 million in North America and US$196.4 million worldwide.</p>

<p>In the 2005 American remake adaptation of the 1997 British film <i>Fever Pitch</i>, Barrymore played the love interest of an immature schoolteacher (Jimmy Fallon). The film grossed a modest US$50 million worldwide and had generally favorable reviews by critics who felt it "has enough charm and on-screen chemistry between [Fallon and Barrymore] to make it a solid hit". She and Hugh Grant starred in <i>Music and Lyrics</i>, which focuses on the relationship that evolves between a former pop music idol and an aspiring writer as they struggle to compose a song for a reigning pop diva. The romantic comedy, released in February 2007, received largely positive reviews, with <i>The Washington Post</i> finding the two to be "great together" in it. The film was a commercial success, grossing US$145 million globally.</p>

<p>In Curtis Hanson's poker film <i>Lucky You</i>, Barrymore played an aspiring singer and the subject of the affections of a talented player. In Raja Gosnell's film <i>Beverly Hills Chihuahua</i>, Barrymore voiced the titular character, a richly pampered pet who gets dognapped in Mexico and has to escape from an evil Doberman.</p>

<p>Barrymore starred in the ensemble comedy <i>He's Just Not That Into You</i>, which received mixed reviews, partly due to her limited time on screen, while it grossed US$178 million worldwide. She played Edith Bouvier Beale, the daughter of Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale (Jessica Lange) in the HBO film <i>Grey Gardens</i>, which is based on the 1975 documentary film. The television film was a huge success, winning five Primetime Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. <i>Rolling Stone</i> writer Peter Travers found Barrymore to be a "revelation" in her role. Barrymore was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film and the Screen Actors Guild for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries.</p>

<p>Barrymore starred in her directorial debut film <i>Whip It</i>. It follows a high-schooler (Elliot Page) ditching the teen beauty pageant scene and participating in an Austin roller derby league. Barrymore worked with screenwriter Shauna Cross for months on script revisions, with Barrymore pushing her to "avoid her story's tidier prospects, to make things 'more raw and open ended.'" While the film found limited box office receipts, it was favorably received; according to review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, critics agreed that her "directorial debut has enough charm, energy, and good-natured humor to transcend its many cliches". For her venture, Barrymore garnered nominations for a Bronze Horse at the Stockholm Film Festival and for the EDA Female Focus Award at the 2009 Alliance of Women Film Journalists. In <i>Everybody's Fine</i>, Barrymore played the daughter of a recently widowed retiree (Robert De Niro). The drama flopped at the box office, but Stephen Holden for <i>The New York Times</i> considered Barrymore "as ingenuous as ever" in what he described as a "small role."</p>

<p>Barrymore starred with Justin Long in Nanette Burstein's film <i>Going the Distance</i>. It follows a couple dealing the ups and downs of a long-distance relationship, while commuting between New York City and San Francisco. It garnered generally mixed reviews by critics, who summed it as "timelier and a little more honest than most romantic comedies", and budgeted at US$32 million, the film made US$40 million at the worldwide box office.</p>

<p>On August 2, 2011, Barrymore directed the music video for the song "Our Deal," for the band Best Coast, which features Chloë Grace Moretz, Miranda Cosgrove, Tyler Posey, Donald Glover, Shailene Woodley and Alia Shawkat. Barrymore starred in the biopic film <i>Big Miracle</i>, which covers Operation Breakthrough, the 1988 international effort to rescue gray whales from being trapped in ice near Point Barrow, Alaska. Her character, Rachel Kramer, is based on Greenpeace activist Cindy Lowry. Despite a positive critical reception, the film flopped at the box office.</p>

<p>In <i>Blended</i>, Barrymore played a recently divorced woman ending up on a family resort with a widower (Sandler). Film critic James Berardinelli dismissed the "hit-and-miss humor" of the story and wrote that "as [Sandler and Barrymore] are concerned, the third time is definitely not the charm", as part of an overall lukewarm critical response. The film ultimately grossed US$128 million worldwide. She and Toni Collette starred in <i>Miss You Already</i> (2015), as two long-time friends whose relationship is put to the test when one starts a family and the other becomes ill. Reviewers embraced the film, while it received a limited theatrical release.</p>

<p>In the Netflix original television series <i>Santa Clarita Diet</i>, Barrymore played a real estate agent who, after experiencing a physical transformation into a zombie, starts craving human flesh. Along with co-star Timothy Olyphant, Barrymore served as an executive producer on the single-camera series, which was favorably received upon its premiere; <i>Rolling Stone</i> felt that "much of [the series' laughs] comes down to the uncrushable Drew Barrymore charm" and furthermore remarked: "The show is a welcome comeback for Barrymore, the eternally beloved grunge-era wild thing—it's not just her big move into TV, but her first high-profile performance anywhere in years. In a way, it circles back to the roles she was doing in the early [90s], playing deadly vixens in flicks like <i>Guncrazy</i> or <i>Doppelganger</i>".</p>

<h3>2020s</h3>
<p>Barrymore starred in Jamie Babbit's film <i>The Stand In</i>. It was set to premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2020, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On September 14, 2020, Barrymore launched a syndicated daytime talk show, <i>The Drew Barrymore Show</i>, which is also available on Spotify in a podcast format. On December 4, 2020, she appeared as a guest star on <i>Martha Knows Best</i>. On March 11, 2021, Barrymore said she was taking an indefinite hiatus from acting.

In June 2021, she launched <i>Drew Magazine</i>, a quarterly released lifestyle magazine by publisher Bauer Media USA. Barrymore was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by <i>Time</i> magazine in 2023.</p>

<p>In September 2023, Barrymore crossed a WGA picket line to continue her syndicated TV talk show, writing “I own this choice” when explaining her reasoning via social media. While SAG had stated that as the host of the show she was not under any obligation to strike, her show continued without unionized writing staff. Audience members showing support for the Writer's Guild were kicked out of the studio, and had any WGA pins confiscated. Due to these events, the National Book Foundation removed Barrymore from being the host of the then upcoming 74th National Book Awards. Barrymore apologized for her actions later that week in a video on Instagram, claiming that, "I believe there’s nothing I can do or say in this moment to make it OK." Barrymore deleted the apology video from her account following criticism. On the 17th, Barrymore announced on her Instagram account that she would be postponing production of her talk show until the strike ends due to the backlash, writing "I have listened to everyone, and I am making the decision to pause the show’s premiere until the strike is over”. She also adds “I have no words to express my deepest apologies to anyone I have hurt, and, of course, to our incredible team who works on the show and has made it what it is today”. A spokesperson for CBS Media Ventures said, "We support Drew’s decision to pause the show’s return and understand how complex and difficult this process has been for her."</p>
