<div>American media franchise</div>
<div>This article is about the franchise. For entries in the franchise, see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (disambiguation).</div>



 
<p><i><b>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</b></i>, commonly abbreviated as <i><b>TMNT</b></i>, is an American media franchise created by the comic book artists Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. It follows Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo, four anthropomorphic turtle brothers trained in <i>ninjutsu</i> who fight evil in New York City. Supporting characters include the turtles' sensei, a rat called Splinter, their human friends April O'Neil and Casey Jones, and enemies such as Baxter Stockman, Krang, and their archenemy, the Shredder.</p>

<p>The franchise began as a comic book, <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>, which Eastman and Laird conceived as a parody of elements popular in superhero comics at the time. The first issue was published in 1984 by Eastman and Laird's company Mirage Studios and was a surprise success. In 1987, Eastman and Laird licensed the characters to Playmates Toys, which developed a line of <i>Turtles</i> action figures. About US$1.1 billion of <i>Turtles</i> toys were sold between 1988 and 1992, making them the third-bestselling toy figures ever at the time.</p>

<p>The action figures were promoted with an animated series, which premiered in 1987 and ran for almost a decade. This was followed by animated series that premiered in 2003, 2012, and 2018, each with a separate continuity. Several films were released; the first, released in 1990, became the highest-grossing independent film up to that point. Numerous video games have also been released, including several developed by Konami. In some European regions, the franchise was titled <i>Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles</i> due to the violent connotations of the word "ninja".  </p>

<p>Eastman sold his share of the <i>Turtles</i> franchise to Laird in 2000. In 2009, Laird sold it to Viacom, now Paramount Global. The franchise has continued with new comic book series, television series, films and video games..</p>



<h2>History</h2>
<h3>1983–1986: Conception and first comics</h3>
<img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d7/Tmnt1cover.jpg/170px-Tmnt1cover.jpg" height="256" width="170" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d7/Tmnt1cover.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d7/Tmnt1cover.jpg 2x" />Cover of <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> No. 1 (May 1984)
<p>The comic book authors Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird met in Massachusetts and began working on illustrations together. In 1983, Laird invited Eastman to move in with him in Dover, New Hampshire. That November, Eastman drew a masked turtle standing on its hind legs armed with nunchucks to make Laird laugh.<i></i> Laird added the words "teenage mutant". The concept parodied several elements popular in superhero comics of the time: the teenagers of <i>New Teen Titans,</i> the mutants of <i>Uncanny X-Men</i> and the ninjas of <i>Daredevil</i>, combined with the comic tradition of funny animals such as Howard the Duck.</p>

<p>Eastman and Laird developed the concept into a comic book. They considered giving the turtles Japanese names, but instead named them after the Italian Renaissance artists Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo, which Laird said "felt just quirky enough to fit the concept". They developed a backstory referencing further elements of <i>Daredevil</i>: like Daredevil, the Turtles are altered by radioactive material, and their sensei, Splinter, is a play on Daredevil's sensei, Stick.</p>

<p>In March 1984, Eastman and Laird founded a comic book company, Mirage Studios, in their own home. Using money from a tax refund and a loan from Eastman's uncle, they printed copies of the first issue of <i>Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> and advertised it in <i>Comics Buyer's Guide Magazine.</i> This attracted the interest of comic distributors, and all 3,000 copies were sold in a few weeks.<i></i> Sales of further issues continued to climb.<i></i></p>

<h3>1987–1989: Toys, animation and video games</h3>
<div><div><div><div><div>Co-creators Kevin Eastman (top) and Peter Laird</div></div></div></div></div>

<p>In 1987, Eastman and Laird licensed <i>Turtles</i> to Playmates Toys. Between 1988 and 1997, Playmates produced <i>Turtles</i> toys including around 400 figures and dozens of vehicles and playsets. About US$1.1 billion of <i>Turtles</i> toys were sold in four years, making them the third-bestselling toy figures ever at the time, behind <i>GI Joe</i> and <i>Star Wars</i>.<i></i></p>

<p>Influenced by the success of <i>He-Man</i>, <i>G.I. Joe</i> and <i>Transformers</i>, which had promoted toy lines with animated series, Playmates worked with the animation studio Murakami-Wolf-Swenson to produce the first <i>Turtles</i> animated series, which premiered in 1987 and ran for almost a decade. It introduced <i>Turtles</i> elements such as their color-coded masks, catchphrases, love of pizza and distinct personalities. To make it acceptable to parents and television networks, the series had a lighter tone than the comics, with no expletives, less violence and less threatening villains.<i></i> In the United Kingdom and some other European regions, the franchise was renamed <i>Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles</i> for the violent connotations of the word "ninja".</p>

<p>The first <i>Turtles</i> video game was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1989, the first of several developed by the Japanese company Konami. It sold approximately four million copies, making it one of the bestselling NES games.<i></i> In response to concerns that the series was drifting from its origins, Eastman and Laird published an editorial in the comic in 1989, writing: "We've allowed the wacky side to happen, and enjoy it very much. All the while, though, we've kept the originals very much ours." Eastman later said there was "some stuff that we wish we hadn't said yes to", and Laird wrote of his dislike for the softer tone of the animated series.<i></i></p>

<h3>1990s: First films, franchise expansion and commercial peak</h3>
<p>The early 1990s saw the commercial peak of the franchise. The first <i>Turtles</i> film was released in 1990, featuring costumes designed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. It was based more closely on the comic than the animated series, with a darker tone. It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1990 and broke the record for the highest-grossing independent film, earning more than US$200 million worldwide.</p> 

<p>A second film, <i>The Secret of the Ooze</i>, was released in 1991. With a rushed production and a lighter tone, it received weaker reviews and was less successful at the box office. <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III</i> (1993) was aimed at the Japanese market, the largest foreign market for US films at the time, but failed to see release there and saw weaker reviews and sales.</p>

<p>In 1990, a stage musical featuring the Turtles as a rock band, <i>Coming Out of Their Shells</i>, played 40 shows across the United States.<i></i> The musical was sponsored by Pizza Hut and promoted with an appearance on <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show.</i> A soundtrack album and VHS were released.<i></i></p> 

<p>After the animated series ended, a live-action television series, <i>Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation</i>, was created in 1997 with Saban Entertainment. It introduced a fifth, female turtle, Venus de Milo. The series was canceled after one season.<i></i> Laird later said it was the only licensed <i>Turtles</i> project he "truly regrets".<i></i></p>

<h3>2000s–present: Sale to Nickelodeon</h3>
<p>Eastman sold his share of the <i>Turtles</i> franchise to Laird in 2000. In 2003, 4Kids Entertainment launched a new animated <i>Turtles</i> series, which ran for seven seasons, concluding in 2009.<i></i> Laird had a role in the production, creating a closer adaptation of the original comic.<i></i>  A computer-animated <i>Turtles</i> film, <i>TMNT</i>, was released in 2007 and earned $95 million at the box office.<i></i></p>

<p>On October 21, 2009, it was announced that Laird had sold the franchise to Viacom. He said he had tired of working on <i>Turtles</i>, writing: "I am no longer that guy who carries his sketchbook around with him and draws in it every chance he gets." In August 2011, IDW Publishing launched a new <i>Turtles</i> comic series, with Eastman as co-writer and illustrator.  A third animated series<i></i> premiered in September 2012 on Nickelodeon, and ran for five seasons before ending in 2017.</p>

<p>A fourth live-action <i>Turtles</i> film, produced by Platinum Dunes, Nickelodeon Movies and Paramount Pictures, directed by Jonathan Liebesman and produced by Michael Bay, was released on August 8, 2014. It received negative reviews, but was a box-office success. A sequel, <i>Out of the Shadows</i>, directed by Dave Green, was released in June 2016.</p>

<p>A fourth animated series, <i>Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>, premiered in 2018 and ran for two seasons. A film sequel was released in 2022 on the streaming service Netflix. In 2021, <i>Deadline Hollywood</i> reported that a live-action reboot produced by Bay was in development. <i>Mutant Mayhem</i>, an animated film co-written and produced by Seth Rogen, was released in August 2023. It received positive reviews, with praise for its performances, script and stylized animation; several critics named it the best <i>Turtles</i> film.</p>



<h2>Characters</h2>
<div>Main article: List of <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> characters</div>
<p>In most versions, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are created when four baby turtles are exposed to radioactive ooze, transforming them into humanoids. They fight evil in New York City, where they reside in the sewers.</p>

<p>Leonardo, the leader, is the most disciplined and skilled turtle; an expert swordsman, he wields two <i>katana</i> and wears a blue bandana. Raphael, the strongest and most hot-headed turtle, wears a red bandana and uses a pair of <i>sai</i>. Donatello uses his intellect to invent gadgets and vehicles; he wears a purple bandana and uses a <i>bō</i> staff. Michelangelo is the least disciplined and most fun-loving turtle, and is usually portrayed as the fastest and most agile. He wears an orange bandana and uses nunchucks.</p>

<p>Splinter is a mutant rat who is the wise adoptive father of the Turtles and teaches them <i>ninjitsu</i>. In some iterations, he was once the pet rat of ninja master Hamato Yoshi; in others, he is a mutated Yoshi. The Turtles are assisted by April O'Neil, who is variously depicted as a news reporter, lab assistant or genius computer programmer. In most versions, she is pursued romantically by Casey Jones, a hockey mask-wearing vigilante who usually becomes an ally of the Turtles.</p>

<p>The Turtles' nemesis is the Shredder, who leads the criminal ninja clan known as the Foot. His real identity is usually the ninja Oroku Saki. In most versions, the Shredder's second in command is Karai, a skilled martial artist; in some iterations she is the Shredder's daughter. The Shredder allies with Baxter Stockman, a mad scientist who is often transformed into a mutant fly in his appearances, and Krang, an alien warlord. Krang was introduced in the original animated series, and was inspired by the Utrom race from the comics. Also created for the series were the Shredder's buffoonish henchmen, Bebop and Rocksteady, a mutant warthog and rhinoceros. Other villains often faced by the Turtles include the alien Triceratons, the Purple Dragons street gang, and the Rat King, who can command hordes of rats to do his bidding.</p>

It was initially intended as a one-shot, but due to its popularity it became an ongoing series.<i></i></p>

<p>After publication was temporarily assumed by Image Comics for the third volume (see below), Laird (by then the sole owner of the franchise) and Lawson relaunched the main series at Mirage with a fourth volume in 2001.

<h3>Image Comics (1996–1999)</h3>

<h3>Toys</h3>
<div>Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures</div>

<p>During the run of the 1987 TV series, Playmates Toys produced hundreds of TMNT action figures, along with vehicles, playsets, and accessories, becoming one of the top collectibles for children. Staff artists at Northampton, Massachusetts-based Mirage Studios provided conceptual designs for many of the figures, vehicles, and playsets and creator credit can be found in the legal text printed on the back of the toy packaging. In addition, Playmates produced a series of TMNT/<i>Star Trek</i> crossover figures, due to Playmates holding the <i>Star Trek</i> action-figure license at the time. Playmates employed many design groups to develop looks and styles for the toy line, including Bloom Design, White Design, Pangea Corporation, Robinson-Clarke, and McHale Design. The marketing vice president of Playmates, Karl Aaronian, was largely responsible for assembling the team of designers and writers, including John Schulte and John Besmehn, who provided the seminal writing and copy for the toy line, which in turn, filtered through to the various iterations of the television series. </p>

<p>Never before in toy history did an action-figure line have such an impact for over two decades, generating billions of dollars in licensing revenue. The series was highly popular in the UK, where in the run-up to Christmas, the Army &amp; Navy Store in London's Lewisham devoted its entire basement to everything Turtle, including games, videos, costumes, and other items. Playmates continued to produce TMNT action figures based on the 2003 animated series. The 2007 film <i>TMNT</i> also gave Playmates a new source from which to make figures, while National Entertainment Collectibles Association produced a series of high-quality action figures based on character designs from the original Mirage comics. In 2012, a new toy line and a new classic toy line from Playmates were announced to be released.</p>

<p>The beat 'em up <i>Shredder's Revenge</i> was released in June 2022. It is inspired by the 1987 <i>Turtles</i> animated series the early Konami games.</p>

<p>In March 2023, Paramount Global announced that a AAA video game based on <i>The Last Ronin</i>, a 5-issue miniseries that was published from 2020 to 2022, was in development. Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global, mentioned the game will a single player third-person Action-RPG with elements taken from the recent <i>God of War</i> games.

<h2>In other media</h2>

<h3>Tabletop role playing game</h3>
<p>In 1985, Palladium Books published <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &amp; Other Strangeness</i>. It is a standalone game, but uses the many key mechanics from Palladium's Megaversal system and is compatible with material from other Palladium games. It introduced rules for creating anthropomorphic animal mutants. Examples of mutants are included in the appendices as potential antagonists, including the Terror Bears, Caesars Weasels, and Sparrow Eagles, as well as including stats for the Turtles and other characters. A series of supplements were released over the next few years, which remained in print until, due to the cost of maintaining the license, Palladium decided to end its license with Mirage Studios in January 2000.</p>

<h3>Food tie-ins</h3>
<p>During the height of their popularity, the Turtles had a number of food tie-ins. Among the most notable of these products was Ninja Turtles Cereal, produced by Ralston-Purina as a kind of "Chex with TMNT-themed marshmallows." The cereal featured many different in-box premiums during its production run. Ralston also produced Pizza Crunchabungas, which were pizza-flavored corn snacks in the shape of whole, circular pizzas (the commercial starred the Ninja Turtles as Will Vinton-created claymations); Hostess Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Pies, featuring a crust covered in green glaze with vanilla pudding inside. Each pie came with either one of five yellow stickers with an illustration of one of the turtles on it, or one of 5 different TMNT II: Secret of the Ooze trading cards inside.</p>

<p>There were also four TMNT mail away items available to order from Hostess and Royal OOZE Gelatin Desserts, distributed by Nabisco under "Royal Gelatin" in three different flavors: orange, strawberry, and lime. Shreddies was a Canadian cereal with TMNT-themed box art and promos. One example of a TMNT prize was rings featuring a character from the cartoon (1992). Chef Boyardee also released a canned pasta with the pasta in the shapes of the four turtles. There were multiple versions of the pasta released, including one with Shredder added into the shapes. Customers could mail away for an exclusive Shredder action figure that was darker than the standard Playmates figure, it was shipped in a plastic baggy. This Shredder is one of the more valuable TMNT action figures today.</p>

<h3>Concert tour</h3>
<p>To capitalize on the Turtles' popularity, a concert tour was held in 1990, premiering at Radio City Music Hall on August 17. The "Coming Out of Their Shells" tour featured live-action turtles playing music as a band (Donatello on keyboards; Leonardo on bass guitar; Raphael on drums and saxophone; and Michelangelo on guitar) on stage around a familiar plotline: April O'Neil is kidnapped by the Shredder, and the Turtles have to rescue her. The story had a very Bill &amp; Ted-esque feel, with its theme of the power of rock n' roll literally defeating the enemy, in the form of the Shredder (who only rapped about how he hates music) trying to eliminate all music. A pay-per-view special highlighting the concert was shown, and a studio album was also released.</p>

<p>The tour was sponsored by Pizza Hut; thus, many references are made to their pizza. Empty Pizza Hut boxes are seen onscreen in the "Behind the Shells" VHS. As part of a cross-marketing strategy, Pizza Hut restaurants gave away posters, audio cassettes of "Coming Out of Their Shells", and "Official Tour Guides" as premiums. The first show of the tour was released on video with a making of video also released. The song "Pizza Power" was later used by Konami for the second arcade game <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time</i>. Cam Clarke and Peter Renaday reprised their roles as Leonardo and Splinter during spoken portions of the concert's kickoff event in Radio City Music Hall, though they went uncredited in the event's VHS release.</p>

<h3>Roller coasters and amusement rides</h3>
<p>Nickelodeon Universe at American Dream Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which opened in 2019, contains several TMNT themed rides, including two coasters that broke world records upon their opening. The TMNT Shellraiser, a Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter, is the steepest roller coaster in the world at 121.5 degrees. The Shredder, a spinning roller coaster themed to the Shredder, is the world's longest free-spinning coaster where riders could spin the car freely along the track, with a length of 1,322 feet (403m) and a maximum height of 62 feet (19m).</p>

<p>Nickelodeon Universe at Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, also contains rides themed to the TMNT franchise. These include Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shell Shock, a roller coaster that opened in 2012, and Shredder's Mutant Masher, a pendulum ride that opened in 2015.</p>

<h3>Parodies</h3>


<p>Although the TMNT had originated as something of a parody, the comic's explosive success led to a wave of small-press, black and white comic parodies of <i>TMNT</i> itself, including <i>Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters</i>, <i>Pre-Teen Dirty-Gene Kung-Fu Kangaroos</i>, and a host of others. Dark Horse Comics' <i>Boris the Bear</i> was launched in response to these TMNT clones; its first issue was titled "Boris the Bear Slaughters the Teenage Radioactive Black Belt Mutant Ninja Critters". Once the Turtles broke into the mainstream, parodies also proliferated in other media, such as in satire magazines <i>Cracked</i> and <i>Mad</i> and numerous TV series of the period. The satirical British television series <i>Spitting Image</i> featured a recurring sketch "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turds".</p>
