<p>In his debut against the Carolina Panthers, Wilson had an interception in the first half, but finished with 258 passing yards, two touchdowns, and a rushing 2-point conversion in the 19–14 defeat. During the Jets' home opener in Week 2, Wilson threw four interceptions against the New England Patriots, including on his first two pass attempts. The Jets subsequently lost 25–6.</p>

<p>Following a 26–0 shutout loss to the Denver Broncos, in which he threw for 160 yards and two interceptions, Wilson earned his first career win against the Tennessee Titans in Week 4. Wilson had one interception, but also threw two touchdowns and completed 21 of 34 passes for 297 yards. One of his touchdowns was a 53-yard pass to wide receiver Corey Davis that gave the Jets a 24–17 lead in the fourth quarter, with the team going on to win 27–24 in overtime. Wilson threw his ninth interception during a Week 5 defeat to the Atlanta Falcons, making him the fourth NFL quarterback after DeShone Kizer, Zach Mettenberger, and Blake Bortles to be intercepted in each of his first five starts.</p>

<p>During Week 7 against the Patriots, Wilson suffered a knee injury in the second quarter after being hit by linebacker Matthew Judon. He was ruled out for the remainder of the game, with Mike White replacing him in the 54–13 loss. Following the defeat, it was announced that Wilson had a sprained posterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, which caused him to miss four games. Wilson returned in Week 12 and won his first road game over the Houston Texans. He also scored his first rushing touchdown during the game. Wilson lost four of his last five matchups, with his final win of the season coming against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 16. However, he improved his turnover differential by not throwing an interception in the five games. Wilson finished his rookie season with 2,334 passing yards, nine passing touchdowns, 11 interceptions, and a 3–10 record.</p>

<h3>2022</h3>
<div>See also: 2022 New York Jets season</div>
<p>Wilson missed the first three games of 2022 season due to a non-contact bone bruise and meniscus tear he suffered in the preseason opener against the Philadelphia Eagles. He made his season debut in Week 4 against the Pittsburgh Steelers and despite throwing two interceptions, had a 2-yard receiving touchdown from wide receiver Braxton Berrios and led the Jets on a fourth quarter comeback drive to secure the 24–20 victory. The victory began a four-game winning streak for the Jets, although Wilson did not throw a touchdown pass in his next three games. New York's streak ended with a 22–17 loss to the New England Patriots, in which Wilson had a career-high 355 passing yards and two touchdowns, but also three interceptions. Wilson rebounded the following week when he completed 18 of 25 passes for 154 yards and a touchdown to help secure a 20–17 upset over the Buffalo Bills.</p>

<p>After completing only 9 of 22 passes in a 10–3 loss to the Patriots the next game, Wilson was criticized for not attributing the loss to his performance. Wilson was subsequently demoted to the third-string backup behind Mike White and second-string backup Joe Flacco. Ahead of Week 15, he was promoted to the second option and started the Jets' next two games due to an injury to White. However, after struggling against the Jacksonville Jaguars during Week 16, Wilson was benched for Chris Streveler in the Jets' eventual 19–3 defeat. Wilson was demoted back to third-string behind White and Flacco following White's return and did not take the field again for the remainder of the season.</p>

<h3>2023</h3>
<p>After the Jets acquired four-time MVP quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Wilson was named Rodgers' backup for the 2023 season, but took the field in the Week 1 <i>Monday Night Football</i> matchup against the Buffalo Bills when Rodgers suffered a season-ending injury on his first drive. Wilson completed 14 of 21 passes for 140 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the 22–16 victory. He was subsequently promoted to starting quarterback. Wilson made his first start of the season the following week against the Dallas Cowboys. After struggling in that game and the following game against the New England Patriots, both losses, Wilson had a strong performance against the Kansas City Chiefs in the Jets' first <i>Sunday Night Football</i> appearance in 12 years. He passed for 245 yards and 2 touchdowns, leading New York back from a 17–0 deficit to tie the game at 20 apiece, but lost a crucial fumble in the 4th quarter that allowed Kansas City to close out the game and beat the Jets 23–20.</p>
