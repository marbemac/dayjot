<p>In January 2016, Kelce starred in the E! Entertainment Television dating show <i>Catching Kelce</i>. The winner picked by Kelce was Maya Benberry.</p>

<p>In 2020, Kelce appeared as a fictionalized version of himself in the first episode of the comedy series <i>Moonbase 8</i>.</p>

<p>Kelce was the host of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> on March 4, 2023. His brother Jason also made an appearance on that episode with their parents as audience members, and was also in a sketch with Travis and <i>SNL</i> cast members Heidi Gardner and Chloe Fineman. He made a cameo appearance on the October 14, 2023 episode.</p>

<p>In May 2023, he signed with Creative Artists Agency for off-the-field representation while maintaining his same agent for his NFL representation.</p>

<p>Kelce is an avid car collector.</p>

<p>In September 2022, Kelce and his brother, Jason, launched a weekly podcast called <i>New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce</i>. In the podcast, they discuss the NFL, as well as each other's games. The show also occasionally features guest stars.</p>

<p>Kelce has appeared in commercials for Bud Light, Pfizer, State Farm, DirectTV, and Experian.</p>

<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Kelce and Maya Benberry, the winner of his dating show, started dating after the show ended in April 2016. In January 2017, Benberry confirmed that they had broken up.</p>

<p>From 2017 to 2022, Kelce was in a relationship with social media influencer Kayla Nicole.</p>

<p>During the 2023 NFL season, several media outlets linked Kelce romantically to singer Taylor Swift, though this has not been directly confirmed by Kelce or Swift. Swift has attended several Chiefs games throughout the season, sitting amongst friends and family of Kelce. The alleged relationship between Kelce and Swift had considerable impact on NFL viewership, with the Chiefs–Bears game drawing the most television viewers of the weekend. Kelce's jersey sales increased by 400%. An increase in sales of Chiefs home game tickets was also documented. NBC used Kelce and Swift to promote the Chiefs' <i>Sunday Night Football</i> game at the New York Jets the following week, producing a promo set to Swift's song "Welcome to New York". The game, which Swift also attended, averaged 27 million viewers, making it the most-watched Sunday-night NFL game since Super Bowl LVII.</p>

<h3>"Fight for Your Right"</h3>
<p>Through his Super Bowl runs with the Chiefs, Kelce became known for reciting the chorus from the Beastie Boys' 1986 song "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)" during team celebrations, first after the 2019 AFC Championship Game then again at the parade in Kansas City after clinching Super Bowl LIV. The Chiefs responded by making "Fight for Your Right" its touchdown song during games at Arrowhead Stadium. Kelce would continue the practice with the Chiefs' second championship in four years, adding a live performance of the song with Jimmy Fallon on <i>The Tonight Show</i>.</p>
