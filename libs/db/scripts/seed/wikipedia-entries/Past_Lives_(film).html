<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>In Seoul, South Korea, Na Young and Hae Sung are twelve-year-old classmates who develop an attraction for one another and go on a date set up by their parents. Shortly thereafter, Na Young's family emigrates to Toronto, where she changes her name to Nora Moon, and the two lose contact.</p>

<p>Twelve years later in 2012, Hae Sung has finished his military service and Nora has emigrated to New York City. One day, Nora discovers on Facebook that Hae Sung had commented on a post that he was looking for Na Young, unaware of her name change. They reconnect through video calls but are unable to visit each other, as Nora will attend a writer's retreat in Montauk and Hae Sung is moving to China for a language exchange. Eventually, Nora tells Hae Sung they should stop talking for a while, as she wants to focus on her writing and her life in New York. At her retreat, Nora meets Arthur Zaturansky and they fall in love. Hae Sung also meets a woman, and they begin dating.</p>

<p>Twelve years later, Arthur and Nora are married and living in New York. Hae Sung, now no longer with his girlfriend, goes to meet Nora there. Arthur wonders if he is a roadblock in their own imperfect love story, since he admits harboring doubts that Nora may have married him to secure a green card for US residency; Nora affirms that she loves Arthur. The following night, the three go out to dinner. Initially, Nora translates each dialogue, but eventually speaks with Hae Sung exclusively in Korean. He wonders what they were to each other in their past lives, and what would have happened if she had never left South Korea and they stayed together. When Nora goes to the bathroom, Hae Sung apologizes to Arthur for speaking alone with Nora, but Arthur says he is glad he met him.</p>

<p>They return to Arthur and Nora's apartment. Hae Sung invites them to visit him in South Korea and calls an Uber. Nora waits with him, and as they incessantly stare at each other, the Uber arrives. Hae Sung says that maybe they are currently experiencing a past life, and asks Nora what their relationship will be in their next life. She says she does not know. When he leaves in the car, she walks back to her apartment, crying in Arthur's arms.</p>

<h2>Reception</h2>

<h3>Critical response</h3>
<p>On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 98% of 247 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 9.2/10.The website's consensus reads: "A remarkable debut for writer-director Celine Song, <i>Past Lives</i> uses the bonds between its sensitively sketched central characters to support trenchant observations on the human condition." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 94 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".</p>

<p>Manola Darhgis writing for <i>The New York Times</i> compared the film to French romantic cinema complimenting its restraint in the presentation of its main themes stating: "The movie’s modesty — its intimacy, human scale, humble locations and lack of visual oomph — is one of its strengths. The characters live in homes that are pleasant yet ordinary, the kind that you can imagine hanging out in, the kind you want to hang out in. There are few big, look-at-me details, though you might notice a poster for Jacques Rivette’s 1974 classic <i>Céline and Julie Go Boating</i> in Nora’s father’s home office in Seoul."
Writing in <i>The Guardian</i>, Peter Bradshaw was fulsome in his praise of the film comparing it to those of Richard Linklater, Noah Baumbach, and Greta Gerwig. He said of the film: "Past Lives is a glorious date movie, and a movie for every occasion, too. As ever with films like this, there is an auxiliary pleasurein wondering how much of her own past life Song has used. It's a must-see." <i>Collider</i> ranked it number 7 on its list of the "20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far," calling it "a story that could only exist because of modern circumstances, but feels timeless in its approach. How does someone choose between two lovers, one that represents the most fruitful days of her youth, and the other someone she has grown to love as part of her reality? Celine Song examines these critical conversations through the perspective of an immigrant story."</p>
