<h2>Background and production</h2>
<p>
<i>Skibidi Toilet</i> is produced by Alexey Gerasimov, better known as "DaFuq!?Boom!" and "Blugray", an animator on YouTube. Since 2014, he has been learning animation on his own without formal education. He lives in the country of Georgia, and was born in 1998. His channel has produced a few prior viral hits, such as when his video <i>I'M AT DIP</i> accumulated over 45 million views.</p>

<p>Every episode is produced using Source Filmmaker, a Valve-published 3D computer graphics software. The creator has said he uses this software because "it allows me to work easier and faster with assets that I need doing animation, direction, writing, and editing myself." The music prominently featured in the series was popularized due to a TikTok dance video posted by the user @yasincengiz38, which was also an internet meme before the series release.</p>

<p>The creator of <i>Skibidi Toilet</i> cites TikTok user Paryss Bryanne's adaptation of this meme as inspiration for his series, in which Bryanne moves in a jerky fashion with quick cuts. Some assets are taken from video games <i>Half-Life 2</i>, <i>Counter-Strike: Source</i>, and <i>Garry's Mod</i>.</p>



<h2>Reception and influence</h2>
<p>The magazine <i>Dazed</i> characterized <i>Skibidi Toilet</i> as "frenetic, unpredictable, funny and at times genuinely unsettling". <i>In The Know</i> compared the animation to a mobile game, describing it as having "choppy movements and exaggerated facial expressions". According to Distractify, the channel is popular with a younger viewer base. Many publications highlighted a viral tweet, in which a user @AnimeSerbia called the series Generation Alpha's Slender Man. <i>Insider</i> claimed the series exemplified the start of a new generation gaining prominence,  using the relationship between millennials and Gen Z as an example, a stance that Indy100 repeated, who commented that "[Gen Z] will be facing the same mocking and ridicule they dished out to Millennials." News.com.au elaborated that "[the series] is a timely reminder that Gen Alpha are on the horizon".</p>  

<p>According to <i>Tubefilter</i> rankings, by the end of April 2023, "DaFuq!?Boom!" entered the fifty most viewed YouTube channels in the United States, at 33rd place. Editor Sam Gutelle remarked that animators "used to struggle with the demands of the YouTube algorithm; now it’s possible to get millions of views with a bunch of pixelated toilets." By June, the channel had achieved a milestone of five billion views, making it the most viewed YouTube channel in the US during that month. Gutelle noted that previously, the channel existed largely under the radar, except for a few "animation diehards in the meme community".</p> 

<p>Trend specialist Phil Ranta explained that the serialization of the series made it so that "people had a reason to come back". They also explained the series' "genuine" feel and just plain luck boosted its popularity. <i>Skibidi Toilet</i> has sparked many fans to create and post fanworks on TikTok and YouTube.</p>
