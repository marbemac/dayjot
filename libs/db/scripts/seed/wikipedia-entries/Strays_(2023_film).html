<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>Reggie is a gullible Border Terrier living with his selfish owner, Doug. Even though Doug only keeps him to spite an ex-girlfriend, Reggie is under the impression that Doug loves him and does everything he can to make him happy, much to Doug's chagrin. </p>

<p>When Reggie inadvertently destroys Doug's bong, Doug makes several attempts to ditch Reggie, which Reggie views as a game. Losing track of Doug in a city hours away, Reggie meets a street-wise Boston Terrier named Bug who teaches him how to be a stray after he defends him from a Rottweiler and a Doberman. After a night with Bug and his friends: an Australian Shepherd named Maggie and a therapy Great Dane named Hunter, Reggie realizes that Doug does not love him. He decides to get revenge by biting Doug's penis off, and the other strays accompany him for support.</p>

<p>During the journey, the group bonds as they get into several situations, culminating in getting caught by Animal Control after a hallucinogenic mushroom-induced high causes them to maul a family of rabbits, which they mistake for toys. During their captivity, Bug admits that he used to have a family of his own but was forced to escape when they tried to euthanize him after he bit the daughter, which caused him to have a mistrust for himself with human kids. In an attempt to escape, the dogs plan to use Hunter's erect penis to hook the kennel keys but are unsuccessful. Then in another attempt to escape, Reggie suggests that every dog defecate on the floor at the same time so when the security guard opens it, they can all run out, in which they are successful. But after escaping the pound, Reggie convinces himself that he is to blame for Doug treating him poorly. This causes Bug to urinate on Reggie's bandana in a fit of anger and Reggie leaves the other strays. Making their way back to the city, Bug, Maggie, and Hunter stumble upon a lost Girl Scout and alert a search and rescue worker to her location.</p>

<p>Reggie eventually makes his way back to Doug's house, and after cutting ties with him and before leaving, Doug slams the door in front of him and attempts to slaughter Reggie. The other strays intervene, and, with their help, Reggie successfully rips Doug's penis off. Hunter also defecates in Doug's mouth, and during the altercation, Doug's house is accidentally burned down. Afterward, the strays move on: Maggie begins training as a police dog and starts a relationship with Hunter, the latter returns to being a therapy dog, the Girl Scout adopts Bug, and Reggie chooses to guide new strays.</p>
