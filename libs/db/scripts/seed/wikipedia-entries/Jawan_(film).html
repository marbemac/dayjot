<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>Azad is the jailer of a women's prison in Mumbai who hijacks a Mumbai Metro along with a group of six inmates Lakshmi, Eeram, Ishkra, Kalki, Helena and Janhvi. Azad negotiates with NSG officer Narmada Rai to ask the Agriculture Minister to send ₹400billion in exchange for the passengers' lives. Kalee Gaikwad, a global arms dealer, learns that his daughter Alia is also one of the captives and agrees to fund the deal. When Alia questions their motive, Azad reveals his plan of donating the money towards the loan waiver of 700,000 impoverished farmers in the country. Azad and his gang directly transfer the funds into the farmers' bank accounts and escape from the metro. Through Alia, Azad reveals his name as Vikram Rathore to Kalee.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Azad meets Narmada and her daughter Suchi, and they eventually get married. Azad and his gang next kidnap the Health Minister and demand to introduce better infrastructure at every government hospital, in exchange for the Health Minister's life. The infrastructure is immediately upgraded in the hospitals, allowing Azad and his gang to escape again after a shootout between Narmada and her team. Soon after their wedding, Narmada finds out about Azad's true identity and confronts him, but Kalee's brother Manish and his henchmen capture and torture them. However, Azad is saved by his doppelgänger named Vikram Rathore. Narmada finds out the identities of Azad's accomplices and confronts them by disguising herself as an inmate, where she learns about Azad and Vikram's connection.</p>

<p>In 1986, Captain Vikram Rathore was a commando in the Special Ops unit of the Indian Army, who set out on an operation to hunt down the terrorist group responsible for attacking and killing 40 Indian soldiers. After facing several casualties that were caused by malfunctioning weaponry, Vikram and his team successfully took down the terrorists and filed a complaint against Kalee, who was the supplier of the weapons. He unsuccessfuly tried to make a deal with Vikram and that same night, he and his wife, Aishwarya, were attacked by Kalee and his henchman, Murad. Kalee took Vikram onboard a plane and seemingly shot him to death. Aishwarya was sentenced to prison for killing three cops, who were on Kalee's payroll. Afterwards, Vikram was declared a national traitor; Aishwarya gave birth to their child, Azad, in prison. When Azad turned five, Aishwarya asked him to prove his father's innocence and provide justice to the oppressed, before she was hanged. Unknown to the world, Vikram survived the attack but lost his memory. He was found and rescued by a tribal group in northeast India and rehabilitated in their village.</p>

<p>Back in the present, Narmada's subordinate Irani is revealed to be on Kalee's payroll, where he tries to kill them in the prison and Lakshmi is killed in the resulting crossfire. Azad arrives at the prison and kills Irani in a stampede. Vikram, Azad and his team attack Kalee's trucks, which contains money for the upcoming elections that will be used to boost Kalee's political ambitions. Azad and his team manages to steal the trucks, while Vikram and his team get captured by Kalee's henchmen. Azad releases another video and states that he has stolen voting machines and demands to seal 253 factories in the country, responsible for air and water pollution. The factories are sealed by the government. Kalee learns about Azad's location in the women's prison and a fight ensues, where Vikram finally recovers his memory and helps Azad by hanging Kalee to death. A few months later, STF officer Madhavan Naik, who was the one who helped Azad in the completion of his missions, assigns Azad a new mission of targeting Swiss Banks.</p>

<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>In late 2019, it was rumoured that Shah Rukh Khan would team up with Tamil film director Atlee. Atlee confirmed the project while promoting <i>Bigil</i>. During COVID-19 lockdown in India, Atlee narrated the story to Khan in 2020, through Zoom call. In May 2021, it was reported that the filming would commence soon. The film is produced by Gauri Khan under Red Chillies Entertainment, while Gaurav Verma serves as a co-producer. The company made a public announcement on 3 June 2022, confirming the project. The film was made on a budget of ₹300 crore.</p>

<p>Atlee co-wrote the film's script along with S. Ramana Girivasan, in his fourth consecutive collaboration with the director. Sumit Arora contributed the dialogues. Atlee further retained most of his norm technicians including cinematographer G. K. Vishnu, editor Ruben, art director T. Muthuraj and stunt director Anal Arasu. Spiro Razatos, Craig Macrae, Yannick Ben, Kecha Khamphakdee and Sunil Rodrigues also were hired as stunt directors. Dance choreographers of the film includes Farah Khan, Vaibhavi Merchant, Shobi and Lalitha.</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<p>Mukesh Chhabra was the casting director. Khan was reported to play a dual role, as father and son, and would be seen in six different looks. Nayanthara was finalised as the female lead opposite Khan, thus marking her Hindi cinema debut. Priyamani, Sunil Grover, Sanya Malhotra and Yogi Babu later joined the cast. Reuniting with Khan after a decade, Babu last acted opposite Khan in <i>Chennai Express</i> (2013) however, he was only present in the Tamil version. Rana Daggubati was offered the antagonist role but declined citing health issues and thus the role went to Vijay Sethupathi. Deepika Padukone joined the cast in August 2022 in Chennai to shoot her special appearance. In September 2022, Vijay was reported to be making a cameo in the film, but later Atlee denied the news clarifying that he himself was making a cameo. In March 2023, Sanjay Dutt joined the cast to shoot for a cameo during an action scene. Allu Arjun was approached to play a cameo but declined the role citing commitments to <i>Pushpa 2</i>.</p>

<h3>Filming</h3>
<img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Pune_Metro_PCMC.jpg/220px-Pune_Metro_PCMC.jpg" height="142" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Pune_Metro_PCMC.jpg/330px-Pune_Metro_PCMC.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Pune_Metro_PCMC.jpg/440px-Pune_Metro_PCMC.jpg 2x" />Part of the film was shot at Pune Metro.
<p>Principal photography commenced in September 2021 in Pune. Some scenes of Jawan were filmed at the Sant Tukaram Nagar metro station in Pune from 30 August to 15 September 2021. Filming took place on the Pune Metro. The station also appeared in the film's poster where Khan appears to sit at the metro station. It is the first film to be shot at Pune Metro. Khan resumed the shoot in June 2022 in Hyderabad. Shah Rukh Khan and Nayanthara joined the 10–days shoot. Nayanthara joined the Mumbai schedule on 26 June 2022, after her marriage. Some family sequences were shot during this schedule.</p>

<p>In August, the next schedule started in Chennai, where Deepika Padukone shot her cameo part. Later Vijay Sethupathi joined the shoot. Some action sequences between Khan and Sethupathi were taken in this schedule. The song "Zinda Banda" was shot during this schedule, in jail. The song, which shot for 5 days included 1000 dancers, and was choreographed by Shobi Paulraj. The song was also reshot for the Tamil version as "Vandha Edam". A month long Chennai schedule was wrapped on 7 October.</p>

<p>The next schedule was held in Rajasthan, in October. Khan and Nayanthara joined this 20–day schedule. Next schedule was held in February 2023, where Khan shot some chase scenes. Sanjay Dutt joined the shoot on 20 March 2023, to shoot an action-packed cameo. In April 2023, a song titled "Chaleya" featuring Khan and Nayanthara was shot at Mumbai and Bandra–Worli Sea Link. Later the same month, the song "Faraatta" featuring Khan and Deepika Padukone, for her cameo appearance was shot at Film City, Mumbai. Both the songs were choreographed by Farah Khan. In mid July, song titled "Not Ramaiya Vastavaiya" featuring Khan and Nayanthara, choreographed by Vaibhavi Merchant was shot at the Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai.</p>

<h3>Post-production</h3>
<p>Post-production for the film began in January 2023 and went on for six months as the film involves extensive computer graphics and visual effects. Editing was handled by Ruben. The VFX work of the film is done by Red Chillies VFX. Harry Hingorani served as the visual effects supervisor with Keitan Yadav as the VFX producer of the film. In April, the company hired visual effects technicians to the team. Ken Metzker of Red Chillies Color did the colouring for the film. Kunal Rajan served as the sound designer.</p>

<p>Nayanthara dubbed for her character in early May 2023. Deepa Venkat dubbed for Nayanthara for the Tamil and Telugu versions of the film. Raveena Ravi dubbed for Deepika Padukone for the Tamil and Telugu versions of the film.</p>

<p>The final copy of the film was ready by early August 2023, and was submitted to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) that month. On 22 August 2023, the film received a U/A certificate from the Censor Board, with a finalised runtime of 169 minutes.</p>



<h2>Themes and influences</h2>
<p>According to Khan, the theme of the film is "women empowerment".</p>

<p>One of the key characters in the film, Dr. Eeram, portrayed by Malhotra, is inspired by real-life events and individuals. Dr Kafeel Khan, who hails from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, serves as the inspiration for this character. Dr Khan became widely known for his involvement in the 2017 Gorakhpur hospital deaths. He was arrested and faced legal troubles related to the incident, which brought attention to systemic issues within the healthcare system. In the film, Dr. Eeram's character likely explores themes of medical ethics, responsibility, and the challenges faced by healthcare professionals.</p>

<p>Another intriguing aspect of the film is a scene featuring Vikram Rathore and Kalee, played by Khan and Sethupathi respectively, which draws inspiration from the Bofors scandal. The Bofors scandal was a major political and financial controversy in India related to the purchase of Bofors howitzer artillery guns for the Indian army. The scandal revolved around allegations of corruption and kickbacks in the arms deal, which had a significant impact on Indian politics and defence procurement. In the film, this scene sheds light on issues of corruption, political intrigue, and the consequences of unethical decisions made in high-stakes situations. Furthermore, the character Kalee is referred to as AB Bofors. This likely signifies a symbolic representation of the scandal itself, emphasizing the role of individuals and entities in larger scandals and controversies. Kalee's character serves as a metaphorical link to the Bofors scandal, exploring the themes of accountability, responsibility, and the impact of corruption on society.</p>



<h2>Music</h2>
<div>Main article: Jawan (soundtrack)</div>

<p>The soundtrack is composed by Anirudh Ravichander, working with Shah Rukh Khan and Atlee for the first time; this would also mark his debut as a solo composer in Bollywood, previously having composed a song for <i>David</i> and the background score for <i>Jersey</i>. Initially, A. R. Rahman was reportedly approached by director Atlee to compose for the film. Rahman subsequently declined the offer for reasons unknown, and Anirudh was chosen to compose for the film. The music rights were bagged by T-Series for ₹36 crore, which was a record price for a Hindi album.</p>

<p>The soundtrack consists of seven original songs composed by Anirudh, namely, "Zinda Banda", "Chaleya", "Not Ramaiya Vastavaiya", "Aararaari Raaro", "Jawan Title Track", "Faraatta" and "Chaleya" (Arabic). Lyrics are written by Irshad Kamil and Kumaar.</p>



<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>On 3 June 2022, the film's title and release date were unveiled through a teaser video featuring Khan in a suspicious character, wounded and swathed in bandages, foreshadowing an intriguing tale of revenge. Later the film got postponed and a new release date was announced through a motion poster released on 6 May 2023. A teaser trailer, titled "Jawan Prevue" was released on 10 July 2023. It became the most watched Indian teaser in 24 hours with over 112 million views. Subsequently, the teaser was attached to the prints of <i>Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One</i>, <i>Jailer</i> and <i>Gadar 2</i> for theatrical screenings.</p>

<p>In July 2023, when the song "Zinda Banda" was unveiled, the hook step, choreographed by Shobi Paulraj and performed by Khan in the music video, quickly went viral, adding to the song's popularity and becoming a social media sensation. Many people have recreated the hook step (signature step) by recording their own dance performances to the song and sharing these videos across social media platforms.</p>

<h3>Critical response</h3>
<p><i>Jawan</i> received critical acclaim from critics who praised its cast performances, screenwriting, action sequences and musical score. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 30 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10.The website's consensus reads: "Packed with plot twists and breathtaking action, <i>Jawan</i> manages its convoluted plot and imposing length with high-octane panache."</p>

<p>Awarding the film 4 stars out of 5, Sukanya Verma of <i>Rediff.com</i> commended <i>Jawan</i>'s political storytelling, writing that it "boldly and directly points fingers at the ineffective government and appeals to recognise the power of the finger and vote". <i>The Indian Express</i>'s Shubhra Gupta wrote that the film delivered a timely political message despite being "fashioned as an unabashed massy entertainer". Monika Rawal Kukreja of <i>Hindustan Times</i> termed it a "massy, meaningful actioner". Nandini Ramnath of <i>Scroll.in</i> believed that the film worked primarily due to Khan, writing that his "screen image – expansive, suffused with love, heroic in an old-fashioned way without being aggressively macho, irreverent but also sincere – helps sell a conceit that might have crashed with any other actor". <i>India Today</i>'s Tushar Joshi believed that Khan's performance and Atlee's direction had improved upon a typical, Robin Hood-esque story.</p>

<p>Sonil Dedhia of News18 labelled it a masala film, adding that it is an "ambitious vigilante action thriller that plays to the gallery and lives up to the hype. Far-fetched in writing but high on star power and style". Renuka Vyavahare of <i>The Times of India</i> believed that <i>Jawan</i> had more of a story and purpose than Khan's previous release <i>Pathaan</i>. Trade journalist Taran Adarsh of <i>Bollywood Hungama</i> awarded the film 4.5 stars and praised its "superlative performances, thrilling and clap worthy moments, larger-than-life action sequences and a never-before-seen avatar of Shah Rukh Khan". Devesh Sharma of <i>Filmfare</i> noted that the action choreography was "on par with any high grade Hollywood film". Saibal Chatterjee of <i>NDTV</i> rated the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and concluded, "Packed with all the ingredients that you would expect in a high-octane action film, <i>Jawan</i> is a strikingly meta vehicle in which a star communicates directly with his fan base and holds forth on themes that are crying out to be addressed." In a negative review, <i>Mint Lounge</i>'s Uday Bhatia termed <i>Jawan</i> a "chaotic mess", writing that the film's story did not cohere despite Khan's best efforts.</p>

<p>Internationally, Manjusha Radhakrishnan of <i>Gulf News</i> compared an ageing Khan to George Clooney, praising the star power of Khan and Nayanthara and the chemistry between Khan and Padukone. Mike McCahill of <i>The Guardian</i> also commended Khan's star power and opined, "<i>Jawan</i> covers a lot of ground in surprising fashion at full throttle – but that’s also a polite way of admitting it’s utterly all over the place." Proma Khosla of IndieWire praised Atlee's work, Anirudh's music and acting performances of lead actors. She felt that the film "must be experienced on a massive screen with a massive crowd". Alan Ng of <i>Film Threat</i> commented "<i>Jawan</i> is a reminder of what action movies used to be". In his review for <i>RogerEbert.com</i>, Simon Abrams stated, Khan "looks especially comfortable in undemanding musical numbers".</p>



<h2>Future</h2>
<p>Post-release, it was reported that the film would have a second part. Owing to the film's success, Khan asserted the possibility of a sequel to the film. During an interview with <i>Pinkvilla</i>, Atlee officially confirmed that the film would indeed have a sequel and also revealed plans to create a spin-off film centered around the character Vikram Rathore. Later in September 2023, it was reported that Atlee had commenced work on the script for the sequel.</p>
