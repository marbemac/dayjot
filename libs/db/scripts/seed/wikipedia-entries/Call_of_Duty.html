<h2>Esports</h2>
<p>The <i>Call of Duty</i> games were used in esports, starting in 2006, alongside the game released at the time, <i>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</i>. Over the years, the series has extended with releases such as <i>Call of Duty: World at War</i>, <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</i>, <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops</i>, <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</i>, <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</i>, <i>Call of Duty: Ghosts</i>, and <i>Call of Duty: Mobile</i>. Games are played in leagues like Major League Gaming.</p>

<p>Players can compete in ladders or tournaments. The ladders are divided into several sub ladders such as the singles ladder, doubles ladder, team ladder (3v3 – 6v6) and hardcore team ladder (3v3 – 6v6). The difference between the regular team ladder and the hardcore team ladder is the in-game settings and thus a rule differentiation. Winning ladder matches on a competitive website rewards the user with experience points which add up to give them an overall rank.</p>

<p>The tournaments offered on these websites provide players with the opportunity to win cash prizes and trophies. The trophies are registered and saved on the player's profile if/when they win a tournament, and the prize money is deposited into his or her bank account. <i>Call of Duty: Ghosts</i> was the most competitively played game in 2014, with an average of 15,000 teams participating every season.</p>

<p>For the past 6 seasons in competitive <i>Call of Duty</i>, Full Sail University has hosted a prize giveaway, giving $2,500 to the top team each season. The other ladders give out credits and medals registered on players' profiles. Tournaments hosted on the <i>Call of Duty: Ghosts</i>'s Arena give cost from 15 to 30 credits, thus averaging at a cost of about $18.75 per tournament. If the player competes with a team, the prize money is divided, and an equal cut is given to each player. Other tournaments with substantial prizes are hosted in specific cities and countries for LAN teams.</p>

<p>The biggest <i>Call of Duty</i> tournament hosted was Call of Duty: Experience 2011, a tournament that began when <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</i> was released.</p>

<p>Playing <i>Call of Duty</i> competitively is most popular in Europe and North America, with users who participate in tournaments and ladder matches daily.</p>

<h2>Call of Duty Endowment</h2>

<p>As Infinity Ward's founders Jason West and Vince Zampella started new contract negotiations to continue developing the <i>Call of Duty</i> Activision around 2007, a number of legal issues arose between Infinity Ward and Activision. Ultimately, West and Zampella were forced out of Infinity Ward, later forming Respawn Entertainment within Electronic Arts.

<h3>Trademark infringement claims by AM General</h3>
<p>AM General, the manufacturer of the Humvee, sued Activision in 2017 for using the Humvee in multiple <i>Call of Duty</i> games. A federal district judge gave Activision a summary motion in its favor to dismiss the case in April 2020, stating that the purpose of the use of the Humvee in the games, to provide military realism, was quite different from the trademark purpose that AM General had established, for selling to the military.</p>
