<p>Darwin, Minnesota, is the home of a ball of baler twine rolled by Francis A. Johnson. It is 12 feet (3.7m) in diameter and weighs 17,400 pounds (7,900kg; 8.7 short tons). Johnson began rolling the twine in March 1950, and wrapped four hours every day for 29 years. It is currently housed in an enclosed gazebo across from the town park on Main Street at (45°05′47″N 94°24′37″W / 45.096332°N 94.410276°W / 45.096332; -94.410276) to prevent the public from touching it.  The town celebrates "Twine Ball Day" on the second Saturday in August every year. An adjacent volunteer-run, free to visit museum and gift shop has information on the history of the ball, as well as selling a variety of souvenirs.  It was the long-standing holder of the "biggest ball of twine" title in the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i>, holding the title from its completion in 1979 until 1994, and was referenced by "Weird Al" Yankovic in his 1989 song "The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota."</p>

<p>In Lake Nebagamon, Wisconsin, James Frank Kotera created the heaviest ball of twine ever built. Kotera, known by his initials "JFK," started working on the ball in 1979 and continued until his death in January 2023. The weight of the ball, 24,160 pounds (10,960kg), was estimated by measuring the weight of each bag of twine. The ball is housed in an open-air enclosure in Kotera's lawn; since Kotera's death, the town has fundraised to move it to the town hall. The ball has a smaller companion, "Junior", that is made of string.</p>



<h2>Largest nylon twine ball</h2>
<p>In Branson, Missouri, a ball of nylon twine built by J. C. Payne of Valley View, Texas, is on display in <i>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</i> museum. The ball, which measures 41.5 feet (12.6 m) in circumference, was certified as the world's largest ball of twine by the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> in 1993. It is, however, the lightest of the four contenders, weighing 12,000 pounds.</p>



<h2>Cultural references</h2>
<ul><li>Most notably, one of "Weird Al" Yankovic's original songs is "The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota," from his 1989 album <i>UHF</i>. Although about the ball in Darwin, Minnesota, Yankovic takes artistic license with the statistics. The location now sports a street sign reading “Weird Alley.”
<ul><li>In a case of life imitating art, postcards that read "Greetings from the Twine Ball, wish you were here," a fictitious invention of Yankovic's, are now an attraction in Darwin.  The Twineball Inn was a restaurant (not a motel) that has since closed.</li>
<li>Yankovic refers to the ball itself, and thus his previous work, in the video for "White &amp; Nerdy", wherein a <i>Trivial Pursuit</i> card which includes the question "In what city is the largest ball of twine built by one man?" appears on screen.</li></ul></li>
