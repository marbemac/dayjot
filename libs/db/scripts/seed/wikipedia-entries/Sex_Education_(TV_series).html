<p>The four series were released on 11 January 2019, 17 January 2020, 17 September 2021, and 21 September 2023, respectively.</p>

<p><i>Sex Education</i> has received critical acclaim for its performances, writing, directing, production value, and mature treatment of its themes. The programme has been a viewership success, with over 40 million viewers streaming the first series after its debut. Wood won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Female Comedy Performance for her role in the second series and the third series won Best Comedy Series at the 50th International Emmy Awards.</p>



<h2>Premise</h2>
<p><i>Sex Education</i> primarily follows Otis Milburn, a student at Moordale Secondary School. Otis begins the series ambivalent about sex, in part because his single mother, Jean Milburn, is a sex therapist who frequently has affairs with male suitors but does not maintain romantic relationships.</p>

<p>Other students at Moordale Secondary include Eric Effiong, Otis's best friend and the gay son of Ghanaian-Nigerian immigrants; Maeve Wiley, an intelligent and rebellious teen with a troubled family past; Adam Groff, headmaster Michael Groff's son who develops a bullying nature out of his own self-loathing; Jackson Marchetti, the head boy struggling to meet the high expectations set for him; Ruby Matthews, Anwar Bakshi, and Olivia Hanan, members of a popular clique known as "the Untouchables"; Aimee Gibbs, an Untouchable who secretly befriends Maeve; and Lily Iglehart, a writer of alien erotica determined to lose her virginity. The school is soon joined by Ola Nyman, whose widowed father, Jakob Nyman, begins a relationship with Jean. Otis's father, womaniser Remi Milburn, and Maeve's mother, drug addict Erin Wiley, later return to Moordale to reconnect with their children.</p>

<p>In the first series, Otis sets up a sex therapy clinic with Maeve to help the students of Moordale Secondary with their sexual problems. Their business becomes a success, but tension arises when Otis finds himself becoming attracted to Maeve.</p>

<p>In the second series, new students arrive at Moordale Secondary, including Ola, who becomes Otis's first girlfriend. Maeve struggles to confess her feelings for Otis, Eric helps his former bully Adam come to terms with his sexuality, and Jean becomes the school's resident sex therapist as a chlamydia outbreak highlights the teens' need for better sex education.</p>

<p>In the third series, a new school year begins as Otis is having casual sex with Ruby while Eric and Adam are made official. Maeve works with English teacher Emily Sands to apply for an exchange program in America, Jean expects a baby in the near future, and new headmistress Hope Haddon's plans for a major revamp at Moordale Secondary creates conflict with the students.</p>

<p>In the fourth series, the students adjust to the new term at Cavendish Sixth Form College after Moordale Secondary is shut down. Otis competes with a rival sex therapist on campus while juggling his long-distance relationship with Maeve, who begins her studies at the prestigious Wallace University in the United States.</p>

Otis, a sixth-form student whose mother Jean is a sex therapist, struggles with his inability to masturbate. His best friend Eric, who is openly gay, informs him that everyone else in their class had sex over the summer. Adam, the school bully and son of the headmaster, is unable to have an orgasm with his girlfriend Aimee, who shares her troubles with her friend Maeve. When Adam goes to Otis's house to work on a school project, he discovers Jean's sexual paraphernalia and exposes this to the whole school the next day. Otis flees the classroom in embarrassment and Maeve goes after him. They find Adam in the abandoned gym lavatory, alarmed at his priapism after taking three Viagra pills. Adam explains the stresses that led him to take it – he is the son of the headmaster and students gossip about his large penis – and Otis advises him to "own his narrative". Adam attempts to do this by exposing his penis in the school cafeteria. He is then able to achieve orgasm with Aimee but she breaks up with him out of embarrassment. Maeve is inspired by Otis's success in helping Adam and proposes that they run a sex therapy clinic at the school and split the profits, with Maeve handling the logistics and Otis providing the therapy.</td></tr>

<p>Filming for the first series took place at several locations in the Wye Valley in both Wales and England, including Llandogo, Tintern, Symonds Yat,  Monmouth, and Redbrook. Filming was also progressed in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan during 2018. The scenes set at Moordale Secondary School were filmed at the former campus of the University of South Wales in Caerleon, Newport. Scenes set in the swimming pool were filmed at the Newport International Sports Village complex.

Production also visited the Harbour Arm in Folkestone Harbour to film a scene for Episode 7.</p>

<h3>Setting and aesthetics</h3>
<p>The setting of <i>Sex Education</i> appears to be modern-day Britain, in the fictional village of Moordale, with various elements that serve to place the show in an uncertain time and location. Modern technology, such as smartphones, exists, but the show features very few cars from after the 1990s, with most cars featured ranging from the 1970s to the 1990s. Police cars seen during the finale of series two appear to follow 1990s aesthetics rather than modern-day police cars. The show heavily features older technologies such as CRT televisions and dated household appliances. The décor of the Groffs' house is reminiscent of popular 1970s décor; Maeve's caravan is typical of the 1990s–2000s; and the Milburns' house is a more modern décor with a modern, "American-style" fridge. Moordale Secondary School shows some elements of UK secondary schools but also has a more American high school image. According to showrunner Laurie Nunn, the show's aesthetic is deliberate and an homage to the 1980s films of John Hughes.</p>



<h2>Release</h2>
<p>On 2 January 2019, the official trailer for the series was released.</p>

<h3>Audience viewership</h3>
<p>On 17 January 2019, Netflix announced that the series was on pace to have been streamed by over 40 million viewers within its first month of release.</p>

<p>According to Netflix Top 10 global viewership, <i>Sex Education</i> was watched for over 447,750,000 hours between 12 September and 24 October 2021.</p>

<h3>Manga adaptation</h3>
<p>On July 15, 2022, a manga adaptation illustrated by John Tarachine began serialization in Kadokawa Corporation's <i>Comic Bridge</i> online manga magazine.</p>

<h4>Series 1</h4>
<p>Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 91% of 80 critic ratings were positive for the first series, with an average rating of 8.10/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Bawdy, heartfelt, and surprisingly wise, <i>Sex Education</i> is a raucous romp through a group of teenagers whose sexual misadventures are so thoughtfully rendered, adults could learn a thing or two from them." Metacritic calculated a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 from 19 critics, indicating "generally favourable reviews".</p>

<p>In a positive review, <i>IndieWire</i>'s Liz Shannon Miller gave the series a grade of "A−" saying, "Again, though, it's the kids' story, with the fluctuations in both friendships and relationships pinging back and forth with youthful verve. <i>Sex Education</i> does a lot of things really well, chief amongst them being the creation of a high school world which feels fully developed — realistic to a degree, but.. [with] a sense of escapism." The <i>Daily Mirror</i>'s Lewis Knight awarded it a rating of five out of five, noting that with "a talented ensemble and explicit tackling of sexuality in young people (and their parents)", it "is an hilariously honest and refreshingly diverse comedy". <i>The New York Times</i>'s James Poniewozik described the series as "timely but not hamfistedly topical, feminist, with a refreshing lack of angst about its subject. Sex, in this show, isn't an 'issue' or a problem or a titillating lure: It's an aspect of health".</p>

<p>In a mixed assessment, <i>The Washington Post</i>'s Hank Stuever wrote, "there's the usual problem of Netflix drift for an episode or two midway through, where the plot dawdles while the writers and producers figure out an ending. Yet there's an artfulness to the material and a genuine care on display here, too — a message that we are not just about the size and shape and inventive uses of our private parts". In a negative review, <i>The Independent</i>'s Ed Power gave the series a rating of two out of five and criticised it, saying, "<i>Sex Education</i> suffers further for not being grounded in a distinctive time and place...Eager to please but confused, <i>Sex Education</i> could do with a stint on the therapist's couch itself".</p>

<p>Ncuti Gatwa, who plays gay black teen Eric Effiong, has received praise from critics and cultural commentators, who noted his role was not relegated to the cliché of a gay or black "best friend" stock character.</p>

<h2>Style</h2>
<p><i>Sex Education</i> is often noted for its unique visual language and aesthetics, which employs American teen culture tropes into a British setting. Inspired by the filmography of John Hughes and the teen comedies of the 1980s, the series incorporates several elements, motifs and designs evocative of those films, and American teen media in general, such as students idling around lockers, non-uniform school dress codes and students sporting letterman jackets. In an interview with <i>British GQ</i>, series director Ben Taylor said: "When [Laurie Nunn] was writing the script and the world, they tended to be on the whole more American references to the school experience I've seen in film and TV than any British ones. There was a tone in the script that was about warmth and positivity. It was just a sort of rendering the school experience as a positive thing, which we tend not to do in this country. I think it also visually elevates it to a slightly more expansive canvas". On the series retrograde setting, notably reminiscent of the 1980s, Taylor explained: "It was always contemporary [...] It was just something we chose not foreground so much, so that it wasn't about a generation of kids who are obsessed with their phones".</p>
