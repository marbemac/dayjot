<p><i><b>Andor</b></i>, also known as <i><b>Star Wars: Andor</b></i>, is an American science fiction television series created by Tony Gilroy for the streaming service Disney+. It is the fourth live-action series in the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise and a prequel to the spin-off film <i>Rogue One</i> (2016) and the original <i>Star Wars</i> film (1977). The series follows thief-turned-rebel spy Cassian Andor during the five years that lead to the events of the two films.</p>

<p>Diego Luna reprises his role as Cassian Andor and also serves as an executive producer. The ensemble cast also includes Kyle Soller, Adria Arjona, Stellan Skarsgård, Fiona Shaw, Genevieve O'Reilly, Denise Gough, Faye Marsay, Varada Sethu and Elizabeth Dulau, among others. Lucasfilm announced a series focused on Andor in November 2018, with Luna attached and Stephen Schiff hired as showrunner. Schiff was replaced by <i>Rogue One</i> co-writer Gilroy as creator and showrunner in April 2020. Filming began at the end of November 2020, with Gilroy unable to direct as planned due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming took place at Pinewood Studios in London and on location around the United Kingdom, and wrapped by September 2021.</p>

<p>The first three episodes of the first season premiered on Disney+ on September 21, 2022; the remaining episodes of that season were released weekly through November 23. <i>Andor</i> received acclaim from critics, who considered it the "most complex, mature story in <i>Star Wars</i> lore". A second season, which will conclude the series and lead into the events of <i>Rogue One</i>, began filming in November 2022, but has since been halted in the first half of 2023 due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. The first season received three nominations at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series.</p>



<h2>Premise</h2>

<h3>Season 2</h3>
<p>The second season is planned to consist of 12 episodes. Ariel Kleiman, Janus Metz, and Alonso Ruizpalacios will direct episodes of the second season, with Kleiman directing six episodes. Tony Gilroy, Dan Gilroy, and Beau Willimon return to write for the season, and are joined by Tom Bissell. Tony Gilroy wrote the third episode of the season. It is expected to release in August 2024.</p>



<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>Disney CEO Bob Iger announced in November 2017 that Disney and Lucasfilm were developing live-action <i>Star Wars</i> television series for the new streaming service Disney+. One of these series was revealed a year later to be a prequel to the film <i>Rogue One</i> (2016). The series was described as a spy thriller show focused on the character Cassian Andor, with Diego Luna reprising his role from the film. Production was expected to begin in 2019 after Luna completed filming the second season of <i>Narcos: Mexico</i>. Jared Bush originally developed the series, writing a pilot script and series bible for the project.</p>

<p>By the end of November 2018, Stephen Schiff was serving as showrunner and executive producer of the series. Tony Gilroy, who was credited as a co-writer on <i>Rogue One</i> and oversaw extensive reshoots for the film, joined the series by early 2019 when he discussed the first story details with Luna. Gilroy had received an earlier version of the script, who compared Andor's relationship to K-2SO to that of Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, and felt it was "totally limited and claustrophobic". As such, he had sent a letter to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy explaining his vision for the series. By the next year, Kennedy had contacted Gilroy to ask if he was interested in joining the series. In July 2019, Rick Famuyiwa was in early talks to direct several episodes after doing the same for the first live-action <i>Star Wars</i> series, <i>The Mandalorian</i>. Gilroy's involvement was revealed that October, when he was set to write the first episode, direct multiple episodes, and work alongside Schiff; Gilroy had officially replaced Schiff as showrunner by April 2020. Six weeks of pre-production for the series had taken place in the United Kingdom by then, but this was halted and production on the series delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-production had begun again by September ahead of a planned filming start the next month. At that time, Gilroy, who is based in New York, chose not to travel to the UK for production on the series due to the pandemic, and was therefore unable to direct the series' first episode. Instead, the UK-based Toby Haynes, who was already "high on the list" of potential directors for the series, was hired to direct the first three episodes. Gilroy would remain executive producer and showrunner. Kennedy announced the series' title, <i>Andor</i>, in December 2020, along with its 2022 release date. Luna was revealed to be executive producing the series, which was set to consist of 12 episodes. In February 2021, Ben Caron and Susanna White were set as additional directors. Sanne Wohlenberg and Michelle Rejwan also executive produce.</p>

<p>In February 2022, star Stellan Skarsgård indicated that the series would have a second season, with filming for it beginning in late 2022. That April, cinematographer Adriano Goldman said there had originally been plans for the series to last five seasons, but he believed those had changed and it was now expected to last three. At <i>Star Wars</i> Celebration a month later, Lucasfilm confirmed a 12-episode second season. Gilroy explained that the original five-season plan was deemed to be "physically impossible" due to the series' scale, and instead they realized that they could end the series with one more season that led directly into the events of <i>Rogue One</i>.</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>In addition to Gilroy and Schiff, writers for the series include Beau Willimon and Gilroy's brother Dan. Gilroy urged his writing team to put aside their personal reverence and nostalgia for <i>Star Wars</i>, fearing that such an attitude could change their behavior and work. Gilroy wanted the series to be accessible to all viewers, not just <i>Star Wars</i> fans, with the hope that those fans would be able to watch the series with their friends and family who are not interested in the rest of the franchise. He had also wanted to ensure the series was grounded in reality and had identified the main "navigational <i>Star Wars</i> piece of information" as being the calendar. During the first writers' room meeting, Gilroy had prepared a 100-page outline for the series, as he had already planned the structure of the series. Writers Beau Willimon and his brother Dan Gilroy were present, in addition to executive producer Sanne Wohlenberg and production designer Luke Hull, calling Hull his "primary creative collaborator on the story". They had discussed the story for five days. Luna expressed his excitement at being able to explore the character of Andor further in the series after making <i>Rogue One</i>, in which the character also appears. Since <i>Andor</i> is a prequel to the film, Luna said it was "nice to go into a story [of which] you already know the ending. Now you can [flesh out] the nuances and the layers. I think it's fun to do something that isn't just about getting to the end. It's about delaying that." Luna was able to suggest elements of the character's backstory that he had thought of during the filming of <i>Rogue One</i>, and was grateful that Gilroy made the character a refugee. He explained, "It's the journey of a migrant, which to me is everything I come from. That feeling of <em>having to move</em> is behind this story very profoundly". Luna felt that because of this, it was "difficult to find out where he comes from", and felt that Andor wanted to "find the opportunities, the freedom, the chances they don't find where they’re born". He had also felt that Andor's character was important to members of the Hispanic and Latin American community, and wanted the "energy" of Mexico–United States relations to be represented in Andor's journey. Gilroy wanted to expand upon Andor's backstory, and had used a dialogue said by him in <i>Rogue One</i>, "I’ve been in this fight since I was six years old!", as a starting point. In the development process, Gilroy had labelled it "The Education of Cassian Andor". From there, he had created the planet Kenari as his childhood home, which he had lived in with other children and no adult supervision. Gilroy had compared it to being a "<i>Lord of the Flies</i>-like tribe", with Andor's separation from the tribe also serving as an introduction to Maarva and Clem Andor, desiring to introduce the audience to the Ferrix culture early on as the writing team had spent time creating its social structure. Towards the beginning, he had described Maarva as loving Andor "as much as she could possibly love him", though in the beginning of the series, she had been disappointed by the direction of Andor's life. As the series had progressed, Gilroy wanted to develop the emotional connection between them.</p>

<p>The first season begins five years before <i>Rogue One</i> and tells one year of Andor's story when he first becomes a revolutionary. The next four years are then covered by the second season, which leads directly into the events of the film. Gilroy approached the two seasons as two-halves of a novel and described the show beginning as "a very simple, almost film noir situation for a thief [Andor]. A skeevy kind of guy gets in big trouble, tries to sell something he has to save his ass". Luna said the series was about the building of a revolution, and said it was important to explore "the revolutionary we can become to change things, to stop war, to make this world a livable place" which he felt was relevant to real-world issues. Gilroy stated, "This guy gave his life for the galaxy, right? I mean, he consciously, soberly, without vanity or recognition, sacrificed himself. Who does that?" He wanted to explore that idea in the first season, beginning with Andor "being really revolution-averse, and cynical, and lost, and kind of a mess". The season shows the destruction of Andor's homeworld when he was a boy and is then based on Andor's adopted planet, which becomes radicalized against the Empire.</p>

<p>Luna and Gilroy said the series was also about "how the disenfranchised can stand up to effect change". Gilroy had not intentionally written the show to create political commentary and rejected the notion of being influenced contemporary events, but said that it had come "instinctively", as his primary priority was characterization and serving the story. The writing team had used history as a "catalog" for the story with Gilroy further explaining that people can interpret the characters however they wish, but the main intention was for the audience to connect to them. Co-star Fiona Shaw described Gilroy's political commentary in the scripts as a "great, scurrilous [take] on the Trumpian world", adding that "our world is exploding in different places right now, people's rights are disappearing, and <i>Andor</i> reflects that. [In the show] the Empire is taking over, and it feels like the same thing is happening in reality, too". Meanwhile, Gough has stated that her character arc in the series deals with gender politics, while Gilroy explained that "We have a very, very, very deep dive into the Imperial side of the story". Gilroy had written Meero's character with the intention of making her character relatable to the audience as she had been putting genuine effort into doing her job and "fighting her way up in a male environment". After starting with Andor's story in the first three episodes, the fourth begins to expand the scope of the series to include the rest of its large ensemble cast, such as Rebel leader Mon Mothma, whose path will cross with Andor's in the second season. Gilroy felt <i>Star Wars</i> fans would see Mothma in a new light after watching the series, and added that there were key characters and events in the series that would be different or "more interesting" than fans previously realized: "What you've been told, what's on Wookieepedia... is really all wrong". Tony Gilroy, Dan Gilroy, and Beau Willimon return to write for the second season, and are joined by Tom Bissell. The final three episodes of the second season will cover the three days prior to the start of <i>Rogue One</i>, with Gilroy saying "it'll be, like, four or five days, and then we'll jump a year, and then there'll be another four or five days, and then we jump a year", with the final shot leading into <i>Rogue One</i>.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Luke Hull served as production designer on the series, and described it as "very cinematic". Neal Scanlan provided the creature and droid effects after doing the same for all of Disney's <i>Star Wars</i> films, including <i>Rogue One</i>. He said his team was treating the series the same as they did the films, and due to Gilroy's involvement the series would fit within the same "pocket of [<i>Star Wars</i>] history" as <i>Rogue One</i> with a "slightly harder edge" than other <i>Star Wars</i> projects. Scanlan added that unused creatures developed for the films could be brought back for the series, alongside newly created creatures. An outdoor city set, which co-star Adria Arjona estimated to be three to five city blocks long, was built practically for the series.</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<p>Diego Luna was confirmed to be reprising his role as Cassian Andor from <i>Rogue One</i> with the series' announcement in November 2018. In April 2019, Alan Tudyk was announced as also reprising his <i>Rogue One</i> role of K-2SO. A year later, Stellan Skarsgård, Kyle Soller, Genevieve O'Reilly, and Denise Gough joined the cast. O'Reilly reprises her role of Mon Mothma from <i>Rogue One</i> and other <i>Star Wars</i> media. Adria Arjona joined the cast in August 2020, and Fiona Shaw was revealed to also be appearing in December, when Tudyk was not included in an official cast list. A month later, Tudyk confirmed that he would no longer be appearing in the first season due to Gilroy's story changes but he could appear in potential future seasons. Robert Emms was cast in a supporting role in June 2021, when Skarsgård revealed that Forest Whitaker was reprising his role as Saw Gerrera from <i>Rogue One</i>. In February 2022, David Hayman confirmed that he had a role in the series after being spotted by fans during filming. The first season has over 200 named cast members and over 6,000 extras.</p>

<p>Luna, Skarsgård, O'Reilly, Soller, Arjona, Gough, Marsay, Sethu, Dulau, McArdle, and Bhaier reprise their roles in the second season. In March 2023, set footage revealed that Benjamin Bratt had been cast for the second season in an undisclosed role.</p>

<h3>Filming</h3>
<p>Filming began in London, England, at the end of November 2020, with the production based at Pinewood Studios. The series was filmed under the working title <i>Pilgrim</i>, and was the first live-action <i>Star Wars</i> series to not make use of the StageCraft digital background technology. This was done because the scripts were more suited to being filmed on locations and large sets, and Luna noted that taking a different filming approach for the series made it similar to <i>Rogue One</i>, whose filming style was distinct from other <i>Star Wars</i> films. Toby Haynes directed the first three episodes, with Ben Caron, Susanna White, and Haynes each directing another "block" of three episodes. Jonathan Freeman and Adriano Goldman served as cinematographers. The series was previously reported to begin filming in 2019, and then June 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both UK and U.S. COVID-19 protocols were followed on set, including daily temperature checks and tests for COVID-19 three times a week. Filming at Pinewood Studios was expected to end in July 2021.</p>

<p>By late January 2021, a large village set had been built on the grounds of a former quarry in Little Marlow, Buckinghamshire, not far from Pinewood Studios, with filming expected to last there until April. Filming in April also took place at the Coryton Refinery in Corringham, Essex, and in East London at Canary Wharf where the plaza under the bridge to the Elizabeth line station served as the entrance to the Imperial Security Bureau on Coruscant. Canary Wharf had also been a filming location for <i>Rogue One</i>. The concrete walkways of the Barbican Centre were used to represent buildings on Coruscant. Several days of filming occurred in Cleveleys on the Fylde Coast of Lancashire in early May, with the town's promenade and beach area dressed as an alien location, later revealed to be the resort planet of Niamos followed by another several days filming in the disused Winspit quarry in Dorset. Second unit and location filming began for at least a week at the end of May in Black Park, a country park in Buckinghamshire near Pinewood Studios which was also used for filming Disney's <i>Star Wars</i> films. By the end of May, main production on <i>Pilgrim</i> had moved to Glen Tilt in Perthshire, Scotland, and was expected to continue there until late June. Around 500 crewmembers traveled to Oban, Scotland, for filming at the nearby Cruachan Dam. This started by June 18, with sets built around the dam and filming also happening in its tunnels. From June 22 to 24, filming took place at Middle Peak Quarry near Wirksworth, Derbyshire. Production was expected to wrap in mid-2021, and Luna confirmed that it had finished by September 27.</p>

<p>The second season began filming on November 21, 2022, and was expected to last until August 2023, with Gilroy anticipating a year for post-production as with the first season. Episodes will once again be filmed in "blocks" of three episodes at a time, with each block moving the story a year closer to the events of <i>Rogue One</i>. Gilroy stated he would not direct in the second season because of his commitments as showrunner. Ariel Kleiman, Janus Metz, and Alonso Ruizpalacios will direct episodes of the second season, with Kleiman directing six episodes. In March 2023 Season 2 was revealed to be filming in Xàtiva and Valencia with director Metz among the cast and crew including actor Benjamin Bratt indicating he had joined the series. In April 2023, filming was suspended in Winspit Quarry, near Worth Matravers in Dorset due to landslip concerns. The next month filming was suspended again due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. By that June, production had been approximately halfway completed. In July 2023, filming was cut short for the duration of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, with plans to resume production after both strikes concluded.</p>



<h2>Music</h2>
<div>Main article: Andor (soundtrack)</div>
<p>Gilroy contacted Nicholas Britell about composing for the series in 2020, before filming began so he could compose source music that would be played on set. Gilroy and Britell, who are neighbors in Manhattan, first met for the project in August 2020. Kennedy and Gilroy wanted the series to have a unique sound, and Britell said it would be "orchestral-plus" with a "wide range of sounds" including some that he had created. He added that the large scope of the series meant that "every episode has new demands, new music, and new ideas. It's important that as the story evolves, the music should evolve too." Britell was publicly revealed to be the series' composer in February 2022, and was still working on it that May when he said they had been "working nonstop for months, actually years, at this point". Recording was underway by then at AIR Lyndhurst studios in London, with a full orchestra. Britell was unable to travel to London due to the pandemic, but had a team in place there that also worked with him on other television series.</p>



<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>A sizzle reel featuring behind-the-scenes footage of pre-production and filming was released during Disney's Investors Day presentation in December 2020, when the series' title and cast was officially announced by Kennedy. Gilroy, Luna, and O'Reilly promoted the series at <i>Star Wars</i> Celebration in May 2022, where they revealed the first teaser trailer. <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>'s Aaron Couch said it showed the "gritty side" of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe. Daniel Chin of <i>The Ringer</i> felt the series had a unique identity in the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise, with a darker tone, and said the teaser "paints a picture of the formative years of the rebellion against the Empire". Ryan Scott from <i>/Film</i> felt the teaser gave the "most comprehensive view at the show up to this point". He said the series could explore the morality behind the Rebels, writing that while they are usually seen as heroes there is also "much gray area in there to be explored". Writing for <i>CNET</i>, Sean Keane felt the trailer did not give much away but gave an "intriguing taste of the show's espionage tone".</p>

<p>Luna promoted the series and debuted the official trailer on <i>Good Morning America</i> on August 1. Hattie Lindert from <i>The A.V. Club</i> highlighted the action scenes in the trailer, saying "In addition to the epic scale and darker tone, the series also promises intense fight scenes created with limited green screen use" and also noted Gilroy's experience with action films due to his work on the <i>Jason Bourne</i> films.  <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>'s James Hibberd enjoyed Andor's increased screen-time in the trailer compared to the teaser, and felt the series was a "welcome scenic change from the company's previous <i>Star Wars</i> shows". At CNN, Scottie Andrew felt it "reveals a bit more about Andor's evolution from common thief to galactic martyr". Luna and Kennedy promoted the series at the 2022 D23 Expo, with <i>CNET</i>'s Keane writing "The trailer paints a pretty grim setup for revolutionary fighter Cassian Andor and his pals, as fighting the Empire and row upon row of Stormtroopers looks like a one-way ticket to death". Meanwhile, <i>Collider</i>'s Rachel Leishman felt the trailer "gives us a bit more of a look at where the rebellion is and who is fighting back against the Empire" and was excited for the portrayal of the Empire in the series, writing "Seeing these little missions and the feelings that the rebels have towards the Empire feels so perfectly align with what we know about Cassian that this trailer really just has us excited for what is to come with the series".</p>

<p>Footage from the second season was shown at <i>Star Wars</i> Celebration London in April 2023.</p>



<h2>Release</h2>
<p><i>Andor</i> premiered on Disney+ on September 21, 2022, with the first three episodes being released. The rest of the 12-episode first season was released weekly, until November 23, 2022.

In November 2022, Disney announced that the first two episodes of the first season would air on ABC on November 23, on FX on November 24, and Freeform on November 25, and be available on Hulu from November 23 through December 7. A similar move was to be also replicated across various countries in Europe, including Portugal, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands, with the first two episodes airing on Fox, on November 24 or 25, depending on the country.</p>
