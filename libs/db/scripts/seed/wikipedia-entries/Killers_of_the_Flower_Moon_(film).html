<h1><i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> (film)</h1>

<div>2023 American film by Martin Scorsese</div>



<p><i><b>Killers of the Flower Moon</b></i> is a 2023 American Western crime drama film directed by Martin Scorsese, who co-wrote the screenplay with Eric Roth, based on the 2017 book of the same title by David Grann. Its plot centers on a series of Oklahoma murders in the Osage Nation during the 1920s, committed after oil was discovered on tribal land. Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone lead an ensemble cast, that also includes Jesse Plemons, Tantoo Cardinal, John Lithgow and Brendan Fraser. It is the sixth feature film collaboration between Scorsese and DiCaprio and the tenth between Scorsese and De Niro, and the eleventh and final collaboration between Scorsese and his musical partner Robbie Robertson, who died two months before the film's release; the film is dedicated to Robertson.</p>

<p>Development began in March 2016 when Imperative Entertainment won the film adaptation rights to the book. Scorsese and DiCaprio were attached to the film in 2017, with production expected to begin in early 2018. Following several pushbacks and delays in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, production was scheduled to commence in February 2021, with Apple TV+ confirmed to finance and distribute the film alongside Paramount Pictures. Principal photography ultimately took place in Osage County and Washington County between April and October of 2021. The film was produced by Scorsese's Sikelia Productions and DiCaprio's Appian Way Productions, with its $200 million budget reportedly the largest amount ever spent on a film shot in Oklahoma.</p>

<p><i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> premiered at the 76th Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 2023. It was released in the United States on October 20, 2023, by Apple TV+, under their Apple Original Films label, and by Paramount Pictures, which screened the film in IMAX. The film is set for an unspecified streaming release on Apple TV+. The film has grossed over $51 million worldwide.</p>



<h2>Plot</h2>

<p>Osage elders somberly bury a ceremonial pipe, mourning the assimilation of their descendants into white American society. Wandering through their Oklahoma reservation, which features the yearly "flower moon" phenomenon of larger plants killing off smaller ones around May, several Osage find oil gushing from the ground. The tribe becomes wealthy after the exploitation of oil on their lands, but federal laws require white guardians to manage their money.</p>

<p>In 1919, Ernest Burkhart returns from World War I to his rancher uncle William King Hale, who also houses Ernest's brother Byron on the reservation. The brothers, in masks, commit armed robbery upon Osage people. Hale, a reserve deputy sheriff popularly called "King", poses as a friendly benefactor of the Osage, speaking their language and bestowing gifts upon them, but he secretly schemes to murder them and steal their wealth. He tells Ernest, who works as a cab driver, to pay special attention to Mollie Kyle, an Osage whose family owns oil headrights. A romance eventually develops between the two, and they are married in a ceremony mixing Catholic and Osage elements.</p>

<p>Hale tells Ernest that he will inherit a greater share of the headrights as more of Mollie's family dies. He has already ordered the deaths of several wealthy Osage, and continues by ordering the husband of Mollie's sister Minnie to slowly kill her with poison (the effects resembling a wasting illness) and has her other sister, the rebellious Anna, killed by gunshot. Mollie's mother, Lizzie Q, blames the white residents of the reservation, as does an Osage council, which urges the members of the tribe to fight back. Lizzie  dies in her bed, envisioning her ancestors welcoming her to the afterlife. These events occur against the backdrop of the 1921 white-supremacist Tulsa race massacre, shown on screen.</p>

<p>After Hale approaches him, Ernest displays a reluctance to kill Mollie, with whom he now has two children, though Hale persists and has Ernest poison Mollie by drugging her insulin. Mollie begins to experience the same wasting illness as Minnie. Ernest botches another murder; Hale brutally paddles him. Hale also orders the death of Henry Roan, Mollie's first husband, and has Ernest order the murders of Rita, Mollie's last remaining sister, and her husband, by blowing up her house. Mollie now owns all of her family's headrights: upon her death, Ernest will inherit them. No outside help has yet materialized: a representative of the Osage nation seeking to lobby Congress is murdered in Washington D.C., and a private detective hired by Mollie, William J. Burns, is beaten and chased away from the reservation by a gang of thugs led by Ernest.</p>

<p>In spite of her weakening condition, Mollie travels to Washington herself, and begs President Calvin Coolidge for help. The Bureau of Investigation (BOI) sends Agent Thomas Bruce White Sr. and assistants to investigate. It becomes obvious to the investigators who is behind the plot; Hale tries to cover his tracks by murdering several of his own hired killers, but White ferrets out the truth and arrests him and Ernest. Even though Ernest, at one point, deliberately drinks some of her poison himself, the agents find Mollie nearly dead and get her proper medical care. </p>

<p>White pressures Ernest into a confession and persuades him to turn state's evidence, testifying against Hale in exchange for legal protection. W. S. Hamilton, Hale's attorney, convinces Ernest to swear that his confession was the result of torture, but the death of one of Ernest and Mollie's three children from whooping cough persuades Ernest to testify. Mollie meets with Ernest one last time, but walks out on him when Ernest lies that he did not poison her.</p>

<p>An epilogue is provided through a radio show. Ernest received a life sentence, as did Hale; Ernest was paroled, but Byron turned state's evidence and avoided jail. Ernest and Hale are eventually released despite Osage protests and live separate lives. The radio show's producer provides the later details of Mollie's life: she divorced Ernest, died aged 50 in 1937 from diabetes, and was buried with her family. Her obituary omitted any mention of the murders. In a more modern time, the Osage celebrate their culture in a large tribal dance.</p>

<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<div><div><div><div>Director Martin Scorsese (top left) and lead actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone.</div></div></div></div>
<p>On March 10, 2016, Imperative Entertainment won the bidding war to make a film adaptation of David Grann's nonfiction book <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> and paid $5million; the studio's Dan Friedkin and Bradley Thomas would produce the film. In April 2017, it was revealed that Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro were considering involvement in the film, adapted by Eric Roth. Both De Niro and DiCaprio had long histories of working with Scorsese, but the three had collaborated only once before, in the 2015 short film <i>The Audition</i>. In July 2017, production designer Dante Ferretti revealed that filming would begin in early 2018, with Scorsese directing and DiCaprio starring. However, production stalled until October 2018, when it was announced that the film would be Scorsese's next effort after completing <i>The Irishman</i> (2019). At that point, filming was due to begin in summer 2019.</p>

<h3>Pre-production</h3>
<p>In June 2019, it was announced that Paramount Pictures would distribute the film. On July 26, 2019, Scorsese traveled to the Osage Nation in Pawhuska, Oklahoma, to meet with Principal Chief Geoffrey Standing Bear to discuss how the Osage Nation could be involved with the film's production. Days later, it was reported that De Niro had joined the cast, with filming tentatively set to commence in the summer of 2020.</p>

<p>In December 2019, Scorsese's cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto confirmed that the film was expected to start principal photography in March 2020, adding that the "look and feel of the film" was still being figured out. At the 26th Screen Actors Guild Awards on January 19, 2020, DiCaprio confirmed that he and De Niro would star in the film. DiCaprio was paid $30 million for his involvement. In April 2020, it was announced that the filming of <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> had been postponed indefinitely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Scorsese had reached out to Netflix and Apple TV+ to finance and distribute the film, as Paramount had concerns about the film's budget reaching $200 million. Paramount was still open to a deal to be involved with the film alongside an additional partner. In May 2020, Apple TV+ was announced to co-finance and co-distribute the film, with Paramount remaining as distributor.</p>

<p>In February 2021, Lily Gladstone and Jesse Plemons were added to the cast. Though the role of Thomas White, the lead BOI agent, was initially written for DiCaprio, DiCaprio pushed to instead portray a nephew of the film's primary antagonist played by De Niro. As a result, Jesse Plemons was cast as White to replace DiCaprio, while DiCaprio was cast as Ernest Burkhart. In March, Tantoo Cardinal, Cara Jade Myers, JaNae Collins and Jillian Dion were added to the cast. William Belleau, Louis Cancelmi, Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson, Tatanka Means, Michael Abbott Jr., Pat Healy, and Scott Shepherd joined in April.</p>

<p>In April 2021, Jack Fisk signed on as production designer for the film, marking the first collaboration between the Oscar nominee and Martin Scorsese. In June, Steve Eastin, Gary Basaraba and Barry Corbin joined the cast. In August 2021, it was announced that Brendan Fraser and John Lithgow had been added to the cast.</p>

<h3>Filming</h3>
<p><i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> was expected to begin production in February 2021 in Oklahoma. Principal photography ultimately began on April 19, 2021, with filming taking place in Osage County and Washington County, namely Pawhuska, Fairfax and Bartlesville.</p>

<p>In a news release before the beginning of filming, Scorsese said: "We are thrilled to finally start production on <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> in Oklahoma. To be able to tell this story on the land where these events took place is incredibly important and critical to allowing us to portray an accurate depiction of the time and people. We're grateful to Apple, the Oklahoma Film and Music Office and The Osage Nation, especially all our Osage consultants and cultural advisors, as we prepare for this shoot. We're excited to start working with our local cast and crew to bring this story to life on screen and immortalize a time in American history that should not be forgotten."</p>
 
<p>On May 13, De Niro suffered a quadriceps muscle injury off-set and returned to New York City for medical attention; production was not delayed, as De Niro's subsequent scenes would be filmed in June 2021. Filming wrapped on October 1, 2021. On March 25, 2022, Osage Nation Principal Chief Geoffrey Standing Bear told the Tulsa Press Club "he was advised <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> is tentatively slated to film additional scenes of a traditional community dance in mid-May in Osage County."</p>

<p>In January 2023, Gladstone said that the input of the Osage Nation greatly changed the film from what Scorsese had originally envisioned and that their collaboration had positively affected the film, stating in an interview at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival that "The work is better when you let the world inform your work".</p>

<h3>Post-production</h3>
<p>Industrial Light &amp; Magic and visual effects supervisor Pablo Helman provided the visual effects for the film after previously collaborating with Scorsese on <i>The Irishman</i> and <i>Silence</i>.</p>



<h2>Music</h2>
<div>Main article: Killers of the Flower Moon (soundtrack)</div>
<p>Frequent Scorsese collaborator Robbie Robertson, himself of First Nations ancestry, composed the score. Critics have described it as "old-timey", "bluesy", and "percussive". The film also features a soundtrack of popular music from the 1920s and Native American songs. It was Robertson's final completed film score before he died in August 2023. The film is dedicated to his memory.</p>

<p><i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> had its world premiere at the 76th Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 2023, where the film received a nine-minute standing ovation at the end of its screening. The film's United States premiere took place on September 27, 2023, at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City, with none of the cast members in attendance due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. The film was originally set to open in select theaters on October 6, 2023, before going wide in the United States on October 20, 2023, by Apple TV+ (under their Apple Original Films label) and Paramount Pictures. However, the limited release was later scrapped, with the film receiving a global theatrical rollout on October 20. Following its theatrical exhibition, the film will be released for streaming on Apple TV+.</p>

<p>As reported by <i>Variety</i>, Italy's Rai Cinema, alongside Leone Film Group, has acquired the rights for local theatrical release over Paramount as they managed to secure the rights in the middle of the film's production progress. Right before the film's second trailer premiered in July 2023, it was announced that the film would also be released in IMAX theatres.</p>



<h2>Reception</h2>
<h3>Box office</h3>
<p>As of October25,2023, <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> has grossed $30.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $21 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $51.2 million.</p>

<p>In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $20–25 million from 3,621 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $9.4 million on its first day, including $2.6 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $23 million, finishing second behind holdover <i>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour</i>. The total was above the average Scorsese–DiCaprio collaboration ($19 million), the highest opening of Scorsese–De Niro collaborations (topping <i>Cape Fear</i>'s $10.2 million in 1991), and the third-best of Scorsese's career; 61% of the audience was male, with "an amazing" 38% being over 45 years old.</p>

<h3>Critical response</h3>
<p>On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 342 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.6/10.The website's consensus reads: "Enormous in runtime, theme, and achievement, <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> is a sobering appraisal of America's relationship with Indigenous peoples and yet another artistic zenith for Martin Scorsese and his collaborators." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 89 out of 100, based on 63 critics, indicating "universal acclaim". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it an 88% overall positive score, with 72% saying they would definitely recommend the film.</p>

<p>In his review of the "meaty and demanding" film following its premiere at Cannes, Peter Debruge of <i>Variety</i> commended the story, characters and themes, but lamented the runtime: "In its present form, [<i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i>] is still a compelling true story... It's engrossing from the get-go, the palpable tension methodically echoed by Robbie Robertson's steady-heartbeat score. But it keeps going and going until everyone we care about is dead, dying or behind bars, with nearly an hour still in store". Conversely, David Rooney of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> opined, "The three-and-a-half-hour running time is fully justified in an escalating tragedy that never loosens its grip" and praised the screenplay, direction, cinematography, score, and cast performances (particularly that of Gladstone).</p>

<p>In <i>The Guardian</i>, Peter Bradshaw called the film an "epic of creeping, existential horror about the birth of the American century, a macabre tale of quasi-genocidal serial killings" and also lauded the "performance of tragic force" by Gladstone. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i>' Justin Chang observed that the film "is both like and unlike anything its director has ever done" and added: "The larger sphere in which [William Hale and Ernest Burkhart] and many others operate is, on one level, a familiar Scorsesean jumble of work and family, money and violence. And yet in its balance of Wild West expanses and intimate domestic spaces, and its focus on Indigenous men and women whose good fortune quickly turns ill, this world is also, for Scorsese, a fascinating new visual, dramatic and political frontier".</p>

<p>Maureen Lee Lenky notes in <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> that "...Devery Jacobs, who plays Elora Danan Postoak on <i>Reservation Dogs</i>, shared her 'painful' experiences watching the film on social media. ... 'Being Native, watching this movie was fucking hellfire. ... I can't believe it needs to be said, but Indig ppl exist beyond our grief, trauma &amp; atrocities. Our pride for being Native, our languages, cultures, joy &amp; love are way more interesting &amp; humanizing than showing the horrors white men inflicted on us. ... It must be noted that Lily Gladstone is a an absolute legend &amp; carried Mollie w/ tremendous grace ... All the incredible Indigenous actors were the only redeeming factors of this film. Give Lily her goddamn Oscar. But while all of the performances were strong, if you look proportionally, each of the Osage characters felt painfully underwritten, while the white men were given way more courtesy and depth.'"</p>

<h3>Legislative responses</h3>
<h4>Film subsidies</h4>
<p>Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma Matt Pinnell named the film as a reason to increase subsidies for the film industry in Oklahoma. The Filmed in Oklahoma Act of 2021 allocated $30 million to film subsidies. Bills to increase the total available subsidies to $80 million in 2023 failed in the Oklahoma Senate after passing the Oklahoma House of Representatives.</p>

<h4>Oklahoma House Bill 1775</h4>
<div>Main article: Oklahoma House Bill 1775 (2021)</div>
<p>In 2021, the Republican-controlled Oklahoma Legislature passed Oklahoma House Bill 1775, a bill regulating classroom discussion regarding race and gender. After the bill's passage, a teacher in Dewey, Oklahoma, cancelled their lesson plans involving the book the film is based on. Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma Matt Pinnell called on the language in the bill to be "clarified so that teachers know what can be taught and not taught". After the release of the film, David Grann spoke out against the bill's regulations and wrote an op-ed in <i>The New York Times</i> on the bill.</p>
