<p>The 2010s marked the growth of football in most of Asian countries both in league quality and its national team. The AFC Champions League also started to spark interest among football enthusiasts worldwide.</p>

<p>In the 2014–15 season, Al Nassr continued to defend their title as champions, by winning the league. However the team kept failing to get their treble after losing in the King's Cup final, as well as only reaching the Crown Prince's semi-final. Their hope of returning as champions they once were was still far under their grasp. Many fans felt let down by their club after losing in the group stage of the AFC Champions League against Bunyodkor from Uzbekistan, Al Duhail and Persepolis. </p>

<p>Al Sahlawi, who was 27 years old at the time was only able to score 25 goals from his 37 appearance that season. For these reasons, the coach was replaced by the former Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita. Even with the Trickster training the team, Al Nassr still failed to break through the AFC Chanpions League.
