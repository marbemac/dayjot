<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>The Randhawas are a Punjabi family who own the prosperous Dhanlakshmi Sweets, named after their matriarch Dhanlakshmi Randhawa. Her husband, Kanwal Lund, is amnesiac and wheelchair-bound after an accident. Their son, Tijori, is much like Dhanlakshmi, and they commandeer over the household, including Tijori's meek wife, Punam, and his two adult children, Rocky and Gayatri. One day, when Kanwal mistakes a lady for a woman named Jamini, Rocky finds a photograph of Jamini and starts looking for her.</p>

<p>Jamini is the grandmother of Rani Chatterjee, a famous television news anchor. Rani comes from an intellectual Bengali family whose mother, Anjali, is an English professor, and father, Chandon, is a professional Kathak dancer. Rocky and Rani decide to unite Jamini and Kanwal. Kanwal eventually recognises Jamini and kisses her in front of his family. It is revealed that they had a brief extra-marital affair back in 1978. Rocky and Rani set up meetings between their grandparents during which they start their own relationship.</p>

<p>Rocky tries to propose to Rani, but she rejects him, dismissing their relationship as a fling. However, she eventually realises her love for him. Because of the cultural differences between the two households, the two switch houses for three months to break the patriarchal cycle prevalent in Indian society. </p>

<p>Rani tries to make the women of Rocky's family more independent, much to the anger of Dhanlakshmi and Tijori. Rocky finds himself being ridiculed by the Chatterjees for his lack of general knowledge. During a wedding ceremony for Rocky's friend, Chandon is laughed at by the crowd when he performs an effeminate Kathak dance. Rocky apologises and endears himself to the Chatterjees by being willing to change his patriarchal ways. He also starts attending Chandon's dance classes.</p>

<p>At the Durga Puja celebrations, Rocky and Chandon dance together to "Dola Re Dola," which angers Tijori. During the confrontation that follows, Rani, in a fit of anger, pushes Tijori. Rocky finds it disrespectful and the two end their relationship. Back home, Tijori tries to hit Punam when she tries to assert herself. Seeing this, Rocky stands up to his father for the first time and decides to leave the household along with his sister and mother. Kanwal finally recognises his son but dies. </p>

<p>A few months later, Tijori, a changed man, visits the Chatterjee household to apologise. Rocky and Rani finally get married and Dhanlakshmi sends the secret recipe of their sweets to Rani, accepting her as a family member, but does not attend the wedding.</p>

<p>The film was announced as <i>Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani</i> on 6 July 2021, by director Karan Johar on his social media accounts. It was also announced that the principal cast would consist of Dharmendra, Jaya Bachchan, and Shabana Azmi, with Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt playing the titular roles. It marked Johar's comeback to feature film direction after <i>Ae Dil Hai Mushkil</i> (2016). He decided to work on the film after his period drama <i>Takht</i> about the Mughal Empire, also co-starring Singh and Bhatt, could not start production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Johar put together a writer's room consisting of Ishita Moitra, Shashank Khaitan and Sumit Roy.</p>

<p>The film marked Bachchan's acting comeback after over a decade; she had previously worked with Johar in <i>Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...</i> (2001) and <i>Kal Ho Naa Ho</i> (2003). The octogenarian Dharmendra agreed to the project believing that the role "suit[ed] my age and image"; he was also pleased to reunite with both Bachchan and Azmi after many decades. Television actress Anjali Anand was cast in her first film role. Saswata Chatterjee was initially approached for the part of Chandon Chatterjee, but he turned down the offer and Tota Roy Chowdhury was cast instead. Chatterjee later called it "the biggest regret of my life".</p>

<p>Johar has said that the inspiration for the film came to him during the pandemic, when he discovered several influencers on Instagram who were gym rats from West Delhi. He decided to base the character of Rocky on them. In preparation, Ranveer Singh spent time with influencer Yuvraj Dua, learning his dialect and mannerisms. The Randhawa household shown in the film was filmed at Gaursons India's luxury residential complex Gaur Mulberry Mansions in Noida. For the character of Chandon Chatterjee, a Kathak dancer, Johar drew on his own experiences as a child who would dance effeminately. To prepare, Roy Chowdhury trained in Kathak for six months. Singh too trained for over a month, for the "Dola Re Dola" dance sequence that he performed with Chowdhury. Vaibhavi Merchant choreographed the sequence, and has said that Singh was extremely nervous to film it as he was not a trained classical dancer.</p>

<p>Principal photography commenced on 20 August 2021. The first schedule took place in Mumbai. In October 2021, the second schedule commenced in Delhi. The next schedule was scheduled for early 2022, but it was delayed due to the Omicron variant spreading. Finally, the third schedule kicked off in April 2022 near Mumbai and Delhi. In August 2022, it was announced that television actors Arjun Bijlani, Shraddha Arya, Sriti Jha, and Arjit Taneja had filmed a small sequence for the film. In the same month, Dharma Productions released a video announcing the film's wrap except for a song, whose shoot was delayed due to Bhatt's pregnancy. The song, "Tum Kya Mile", was filmed in March 2023 in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, thus wrapping the film. Johar has said that the "Tum Kya Mile" sequence was inspired by the romantic songs in Yash Chopra's films while the "Dhindora Baje Re" sequence was inspired by the scale and grandeur of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's films. He also paid tribute to actress Sadhana with the song "What Jhumka?", adapted from her song "Jhumka Gira Re" in the film <i>Mera Saaya</i> (1966).</p>

<p>The first cut of the film was 3 hours and 12 minutes long. Johar held several test screenings for the film for over 500 people, and after an editing process of over six months with editor Nitin Baid, the final cut was brought down to 2 hours and 48 minutes.</p>



<h2>Soundtrack</h2>
<div>Main article: Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani (soundtrack)</div>

<p>The music of the film is composed by Pritam and lyrics are written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. Pritam described the album as a "homage" to Hindi film music of the 1960s and 1970s. Saregama bought the music rights for ₹30 crore (US$3.8million). Johar termed it both a strategic and emotional decision, as Saregama (then-named HMV) had released the music for his company Dharma Production's early films <i>Gumrah</i> (1993) and <i>Duplicate</i> (1998). The sale also allowed Johar to use Saragema's catalogue of old Hindi film music without buying additional rights.</p>

<p>The first single, titled "Tum Kya Mile" was released on 28 June 2023. The second single, "What Jhumka?", adapted from Madan Mohan's 1966 song "Jhumka Gira Re", was released on 12 July. The third single, titled "Ve Kamleya" was released on 18 July, and the fourth single, titled "Dhindhora Baje Re", was released on 24 July.</p> 

<p>The entire album, consisting of 13 tracks, was released on 31 July 2023.</p>

Tushar Joshi of <i>India Today</i> termed it a gentle reminder of Karan’s legacy. Dhaval Roy of <i>The Times of India</i> wrote that it is "a full-on entertaining and sweet love story, with flashy and feisty characters given to us in a well-wrapped shiny package". <i>The Telegraph</i>'s Priyanka Roy labelled it a return to form for Johar, terming it a "vastly entertaining film which doesn't forget to be meaty and meaningful". Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com termed it a "shrewd subversion of traditions and values by the same man who popularised and glamorised its virtues to the hilt". Her colleague, Mayur Sanap, believed that the film "blends old charm with the newness of fresh ideas". Reya Malhotra of <i>The Week</i> termed it a feminist retelling of Johar's own <i>Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...</i> (2001).</p>

Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in found it "ostentatious" and "pretentious", and criticised its "overly long, tonally jittery, and stereotype-filled narrative". NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee concluded that "the film is a shiny but shallow family drama that uses disappointingly obsolete methods to serve up contemporary, pertinent theories about the need to be mindful in love, loyalty and language"; however, he praised the performances, particularly that of Bhatt.</p>

<p>Internationally, Ryan Gilbey of <i>The Guardian</i> opined that "<i>Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani</i> is fascinating in its attempts to address the clash between progressiveness and tradition".
