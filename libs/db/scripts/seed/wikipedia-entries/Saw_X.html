<p><i><b>Saw X</b></i> is a 2023 American horror film directed and edited by Kevin Greutert and written by Peter Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg.

As retribution, he kidnaps those responsible and subjects them to his trademark death traps.</p>

<p>A tenth installment was reported to be in development with Twisted Pictures in April 2021, when Stolberg and Goldfinger, writers for the previous two entries of the series, announced that they had completed the script in December 2021. Greutert, who had directed two other installments of the series and edited six, was also confirmed as the film's director. Filming took place from October 2022 to February 2023 in Mexico City.</p>

<p><i>Saw X</i> was theatrically released by Lionsgate Films on September 29, 2023. It has grossed $78 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise especially towards Bell's performance, becoming the best reviewed "Saw" film.</p>



<h2>Plot</h2>

<p>John Kramer is told that, due to his advanced brain cancer, he has only months to live. After a CT scan, he witnesses a custodian stealing from a patient in the next room and imagines a trap where the custodian fails to turn a dial to break all fingers on his right hand before having both eyes sucked out by vacuum tubes. After seeing John at the window of the patient's room, the custodian returns the stolen items.</p>

<p>John later attends a cancer support meeting, where he meets Henry Kessler, who claims to have also gotten a terminal cancer diagnosis. John later encounters a seemingly healthy Henry, who claims to have been cured by an experimental Norwegian cancer treatment conducted by a group led by Dr. Pederson. A desperate John contacts the doctor's daughter Cecilia, who refers him to her clinic in Mexico City.</p>

<p>John is driven to the clinic by taxi driver Diego and meets Cecilia and her team—Mateo, Valentina, and Dr. Cortez—as well as a young woman named Gabriela who claims to have been cured by Cecilia, and another patient, Parker Sears, who just underwent surgery. John also meets Carlos, a young boy who lives nearby; the two bond when John fixes his bike. John goes under for surgery, and he wakes up to Cecilia telling him that he is now cancer-free. Finding a new lease on life, John purchases a gift for Gabriela; however, upon returning to the clinic, he finds it abandoned and realizes that the whole operation was a scam.</p>

<p>Deducing "Dr. Cortez" was Diego in disguise, John kidnaps and interrogates him. He then places Diego in a trap where he must remove explosives wired to his arms by cutting through his flesh, which Diego successfully performs. Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda Young then kidnaps Cecilia, Mateo, Valentina, and Gabriela; the four wake up in the clinic, now subjects of John and Amanda's <i>Jigsaw</i> games.</p>

<p>Valentina is tasked with severing her leg with a Gigli saw and extracting enough bone marrow to release a key to free herself. Although she succeeds in removing her leg, she is unable to escape in time and is decapitated by another Gigli saw. Cecilia disembowels Valentina's corpse and uses her intestines as a rope to lure her phone and calls for help, but Amanda shocks her into submission and confiscates the phone. Parker breaks into the clinic, claiming he wants his money back. Amanda restrains Parker while Mateo is forced to drill into his own skull and remove a portion of his cerebral tissue to obtain a key. Despite succeeding, after the tissue takes too long to dissolve, a heated mask closes on his face, killing him. Next, Gabriela is suspended from shackles around her wrist and ankle while being subjected to ionizing radiation and must use a sledgehammer to break her shackled limbs and escape. She succeeds and John orders Amanda to take her to a hospital. However, before she can, the now-free Parker forces them at gunpoint to free Cecilia.</p>

<p>Cecilia kills Gabriela by breaking her neck and reveals she called Parker, who is part of the scam, to free her. She forces John to chain himself in her trap. She hears Carlos outside of the facility and having noticed John befriend the boy, chains him up opposite John on a seesaw-like trap which waterboards them with blood. Parker and Cecilia leave to retrieve the bag of stolen cash from John's control room; however, a tripwire is activated that seals Parker and Cecilia in the room and frees John and Carlos. John reveals Diego outed all of the scammers—including Parker and Henry—and tricked Cecilia into luring him to the facility. A deadly chemical gas begins filling the room, with the only respite being a ventilation hole large enough for one person's head, forcing Cecilia and Parker to fight each other, to the former's victory. Cecilia can only watch as John, Amanda, and Carlos (to whom John gave the money) leave the facility while she is left imprisoned.</p>

<p>Sometime later, Henry awakens in a dilapidated bathroom with a new trap strapped to his stomach, overseen by John and Mark Hoffman.</p>

<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>In April 2021, a tenth film installment to the <i>Saw</i> franchise, titled <i>Saw X</i>, was reported to be in development with Twisted Pictures. Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger, writers for the previous two entries of the series, <i>Jigsaw</i> (2017) and <i>Spiral</i> (2021), confirmed the script was completed in December 2021. Producers Mark Burg and Oren Koules had planned the story of <i>Saw X</i> since 2018, but plans for the film were put on hold when Michael Burns, the Vice President of Lionsgate, met with Chris Rock in Brazil and approved his pitch for <i>Spiral</i>. That film's box office under-performance led Burg and Koules to go back to the franchise's roots for its tenth installment and make the story they had planned. In August 2022, Bloody Disgusting reported the film would be directed by Kevin Greutert, who edited most of the previous installments, and directed <i>Saw VI</i> (2009) and <i>Saw 3D</i> (2010).</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<p>In October 2022, Tobin Bell was confirmed to reprise the role of John Kramer / Jigsaw. Greutert told <i>Empire</i> that Bell is featured in the film more than any other in the series.  Bell was also involved in the film's script and post-production, coming up with extra dialogue that was incorporated into the story after shooting concluded. In December 2022, Synnøve Macody Lund, Steven Brand and Michael Beach joined the cast,  along with Renata Vaca, Paulette Hernandez, Joshua Okamoto and Octavio Hinojosa. Shawnee Smith reprises her role as Amanda Young. While never officially announced, Costas Mandylor returned with a surprise cameo of his role as Mark Hoffman, though his return was implied by his voice present in the trailer. Greutert told <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> that this cameo was "the most fan-servicey thing" he has done.</p>

<h3>Filming</h3>

<p>On a budget of $13 million, principal photography took place on location in Mexico City from late October 2022 to February 2023. The trap designs were more complex than in previous installments, so the filming schedule was split into two parts—three weeks in November and three weeks in January. Greutert told <i>SFX</i>, "We had to make so many prosthetics and machines, and over Christmas, we spent the entirety of it figuring this stuff out".</p>

<p>At the Midsummer Scream 2023 convention, cinematographer Nick Matthews said they wanted to pay homage to the earlier <i>Saw</i> films. He explained, "I think for Kevin and I, it was really important that we were able to pay homage to all the early films, we love that the early films are [1.85] (ratio), we love that they're textural, that they're gritty, that there's these really bold, yellow color palettes, and we want to do our work to hearken to that, with pervasive darkness, and really throwing the audience subjectively right into this graphic, gritty world".  Production designer Anthony Stabley looked back at the color palette from those mid-2000s films and ensured that all technology, like graphics, seen in <i>Saw X</i> would have been available when those films took place.</p>

<h3>Post-production</h3>
<p>Most of the gore was done with practical effects, with CGI only being used for touch-ups. The filmmakers considered the use of visual effects to de-age Bell and Smith due to the 17-year gap between their appearances in <i>Saw III</i> (2006), in which their characters both died, and <i>Saw X</i>. However, they chose not to pursue his course of action; Greutert expressed his support for this decision, saying that "some of the films that have de-aged their actors, it puts some distance between the character and the audience", feeling that Bell and Smith have some emotional close-ups that should not be altered.</p>

<p>Steve Forn, the film's first assistant editor, had local police called on him during an editing session involving sound design of the custodian's trap— and "naturally, there's a lot of screaming in the sequence." The police, to quote the neighbors, had concerns about [someone] being tortured to death in here, to which Forn replies with "Actually, I'm just working on a movie. You can come in and see it if you want?" The police laughed, saying "We want to but, you know, you're all right".</p>



<h2>Release</h2>
<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>On September 9, 2023, Lionsgate announced the return of the <i>Saw</i> Blood Drive, a promotional event allowing audiences to donate blood to the American Red Cross in exchange for free tickets to the opening weekend of <i>Saw X</i>.</p> 

<p>On September 13, 2023, a parody of the Nicole Kidman AMC Theatres commercial was published to YouTube and to Lionsgate's social media platforms. It featured a remote-controlled Billy the Puppet on a tricycle in place of Kidman, with some slight changes to reflect the graphic nature of <i>Saw</i>. While the parody was met with humorous responses by news outlets, it was pulled from Lionsgate's accounts due to a cease and desist order by AMC Theatres. Writer Josh Stolberg released a statement on the trailer's takedown, calling people "lucky" if they managed to watch the parody before its removal, though re-uploads have spread across multiple channels not affiliated with Lionsgate.</p>

<p><i>Saw X</i> topped the box office in the United Kingdom and Ireland, grossing $2.31 million in the first three days.</p>

<h3>Critical response</h3>
<p>The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised Bell's performance, adding that it was the best entry in the franchise since the first film. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 79% of 141 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.5/10.The website's consensus reads: "Led by a franchise-best performance by Tobin Bell, <i>Saw X</i> reinvigorates the series with an installment that has a surprising amount of heart to go with all the gore." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 60 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews. It is the highest-rated film of the franchise on both websites, topping the first (50%) and third film (48 out of 100), respectively. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it an 82% overall positive score, with 62% saying they would definitely recommend the film.</p>

<p><i>Variety</i>'s Owen Gleiberman wrote that <i>Saw X</i> seemed "more like a real movie than many of the films in the series in that there's more talking and less torturing". He was satisfied with that ratio but was concerned if it would "pay off at the box office". He explained, "The torture set pieces in the <i>Saw</i> films are lavish gifts of baroque horror presented to the audience. They are, quite simply, the reason we came".  He gave particular praise to Tobin Bell, "with his stare of pitiless wisdom".  Frank Scheck of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> also praised Bell for his performance, saying "None of this would work nearly as well without Bell, whose raspy voice and menacing gravitas are so riveting that he makes Jigsaw's oft-repeated declaration 'I'd like to play a game' scary as hell".</p>

<p>Beatrice Loayza called <i>Saw X</i> the "most well-groomed <i>Saw</i> film to date" in her review for <i>The New York Times</i>. She continues with: "The story mostly makes sense and Greutert pulls back on the frenetic editing techniques that made the older movies look like the blood and guts equivalent of white noise". Bob Strauss of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> called the film "a well-told tale" and praised its character development and plot twists. Wendy Ide of <i>The Observer</i> gave three stars out of five despite calling the film "unpleasant"— in her review she insists "that's rather the point."</p>

<p>Helen O'Hara from <i>Empire</i> gave the film a score of two out of five, positively commenting on the blood and gore, calling it "all present and correct." However, O'Hara criticized the film's main focus on Kramer's vulnerability and human side, adding that it "sits at odds with his awful judgmentalism. Let monsters be monsters."  Kyle Turner writing for <i>Slant</i> gave the film a score of two and half out of four, saying "The real disappointment is that Shawnee Smith, who makes a return to the series for the first time since <i>Saw VI</i>, is relegated to mostly doing John's dirty work. It's hard out here for a disciple, and Smith hasn't had the chance to show off her chops as an actor since <i>Saw III</i>. But in <i>Saw X</i>, we do get crumbs of what makes her so thrilling as a performer, particularly one in the horror genre: She’s all id, a tempest of emotion and fully embodied desperation and psychosis."</p>
