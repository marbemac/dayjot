<h1>NXT No Mercy</h1>

<div>WWE livestreaming event</div>

<p><b>NXT No Mercy</b> was the 14th No Mercy professional wrestling supercard produced by WWE. It primarily featured wrestlers from the promotion's NXT brand division. The event took place on Saturday, September 30, 2023, and was livestreamed from the Mechanics Bank Arena in Bakersfield, California. This was the first No Mercy event held since 2017, the first to livestream on Peacock, the first to be held on a Saturday, and the first to not be available on traditional pay-per-view.</p>

<p>This was WWE's first livestreaming event in which the company was not owned and controlled by the McMahon family, as the company's sale to Endeavor was finalized on September 12, 2023, with WWE and Ultimate Fighting Championship merging to become divisions of a new entity called TKO Group Holdings. NXT No Mercy in turn marked WWE's first livestreaming event under TKO.</p>

<p>Seven matches were contested at the event, including one on the pre-show. In the main event, Raw's Becky Lynch defeated Tiffany Stratton in an Extreme Rules match to retain the NXT Women's Championship. In another prominent match, Ilja Dragunov defeated Carmelo Hayes to win the NXT Championship.</p>

<p>No Mercy was first held by the American professional wrestling promotion WWE as a United Kingdom-exclusive pay-per-view (PPV) in May 1999. A second No Mercy was then held later that same year in October, but in the United States, which established No Mercy as the annual October PPV for the promotion until 2008. No Mercy was discontinued in 2009, but it was reinstated in October 2016 following the reintroduction of the brand extension, which brought back brand-exclusive PPVs. Following WrestleMania 34 in April 2018, however, No Mercy was discontinued as WWE ended brand-exclusive PPVs, resulting in the reduction of yearly PPVs produced.</p>

<p>On July 27, 2023, WWE announced the return of No Mercy for their developmental brand, NXT. The 14th No Mercy was scheduled to take place on Saturday, September 30 at the Mechanics Bank Arena in Bakersfield, California, marking the first No Mercy to be held on a Saturday. In addition to the WWE Network in most international markets, it was the first No Mercy to livestream on Peacock after the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March 2021. It was subsequently the first No Mercy to not air on traditional PPV as NXT events ceased airing on PPV beginning in 2022.</p>

<p>From January 2023, there had been speculation that WWE had been placed up for sale. Hours before WrestleMania 39 Night 2 began, CNBC reported via multiple sources that a deal between WWE and Endeavor, the parent company of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) via Zuffa, was imminent. The deal involved a merger of WWE with the UFC into a new publicly traded company, with Endeavor holding a 51% stake. The sale was confirmed the next day on April 3, 2023 and was finalized on September 12, with WWE merging with the UFC to become divisions of TKO Group Holdings. NXT No Mercy was in turn WWE's first livestreaming event held in which the company was not owned and controlled by the McMahon family, and subsequently the first livestreaming event under TKO.</p>

<h3>Storylines</h3>
<p>The card included seven matches that were the result of scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the NXT brand, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television program, <i>NXT</i>, and the supplementary online streaming show, <i>Level Up</i>.</p>

<p>At <i>NXT</i>: Heatwave, during a celebration with Meta-Four backstage after Noam Dar won the NXT Heritage Cup, Dar received a letter from the Heritage Cup Committee. The letter stated that on the next episode, a global number one contender's tournament would start, and Dar would defend the Heritage Cup against the winner at No Mercy. On August 23 during <i>WWE The Bump</i>, the rules of the "NXT Global Heritage Invitational" were explained. The tournament would be a round-robin style tournament featuring two groups with four wrestlers in each group. Matches would have a 12-minute time limit, and victories would earn a wrestler two points, while a 12-minute draw earned both wrestlers one point. The winner of Group A would then face the winner of Group B on the September 26 episode of <i>NXT</i> to determine the number one contender. On August 24, the first two participants were revealed as Tyler Bate in Group A and Joe Coffey in Group B. Two days later, four more contestants were announced: Butch and Charlie Dempsey for Group A  and Duke Hudson and Nathan Frazer for Group B. The next day, the last two contestants were announced as Axiom in Group A and Akira Tozawa in Group B. In the final on September 26, Butch defeated Coffey, earning an NXT Heritage Cup championship match against Dar at No Mercy.</p>

<p>On the September 12 episode of <i>NXT</i>, Baron Corbin praised Bron Breakker for (kayfabe) crushing Von Wagner's skull with the steel steps the previous week. Breakker said he did not attack Wagner to gain Corbin's approval and that he did not want or need Corbin's respect. Breakker then challenged Corbin to a match at No Mercy, which was later made official.</p>

<p>During <i>NXT</i>: Heatwave, NXT Women's Champion Tiffany Stratton named off a list of previous title holders and mistakenly claimed Raw's Becky Lynch as a former champion. At the main roster event Payback, Stratton appeared and apologized to Lynch. After Stratton's successful title defense against Kiana James on the following episode of <i>NXT</i>, Lynch appeared and challenged Stratton to a title match the following week, where Lynch defeated Stratton to win the title for the first time in her career, thus making her a Grand Slam Champion. The following week, Lynch offered Stratton a rematch at any time of her choosing, which was scheduled for No Mercy. After Lynch and Lyra Valkyria defeated Stratton and James in a tag team match later that night, Stratton attacked Lynch, who challenged Stratton to an Extreme Rules match at the event, which Stratton accepted.</p>

<p>At The Great American Bash, Carmelo Hayes defeated Ilja Dragunov to retain the NXT Championship. Almost a month later, Hayes retained the title against Wes Lee at <i>NXT</i>: Heatwave. The following week, Dragunov stated that his goal was to win the NXT Championship, while on Instagram, Lee also expressed his desire to win the title. On the September 5 episode, a match between Lee and Dragunov was scheduled for the following week with the winner facing Hayes for the title at No Mercy, which Dragunov won.</p>

<p>On the August 29 episode of <i>NXT</i>, Mustafa Ali and Dragon Lee argued over who should challenge for the NXT North American Championship, held by Raw's "Dirty" Dominik Mysterio. A match between Ali and Lee, with Mysterio serving as the special guest referee, was scheduled for the following week with the winner facing Mysterio for the title at No Mercy, which was won by Ali after a fast count by Mysterio. On September 21, however, Ali was among the wrestlers who were released from their WWE contracts. On September 26, Shawn Michaels announced on X that a triple threat match would be held on that night's episode of <i>NXT</i> between Lee, Axiom, and Tyler Bate to determine who would instead challenge Mysterio for the title at No Mercy. That same night, Trick Williams inserted himself into the match, making it a fatal four-way match, which Williams won. It was also announced that Lee would serve as the special guest referee.</p>
