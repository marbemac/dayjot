He made his Broadway debut in Nora Ephron's <i>Lucky Guy</i> (2013) earning a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination.</p>



<h2>Early life and family</h2>
<p>Hanks was born in Concord, California, on July 9, 1956, to hospital worker Janet Marylyn (néeFrager) and itinerant cook Amos "Bud" Hanks. His mother was from a Portuguese family; their surname was originally "Fraga". His father had English ancestry, and through his line, Hanks is a distant cousin of President Abraham Lincoln and children's host Fred Rogers, whom he played. His parents divorced in 1960. Their three oldest children, Sandra (later Sandra Hanks Benoiton, a writer), Larry (who became an entomology professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign), and Tom, went with their father, while the youngest, Jim (who also became an actor and filmmaker), remained with their mother in Red Bluff, California. In his childhood, Hanks' family moved often; by the age of 10, he had lived in 10 different houses.</p>

<p>While Hanks' family religious history was Catholic and Mormon, one journalist characterized Hanks' teenage self as being a "Bible-toting evangelical" for several years. In school, he was unpopular with students and teachers alike, later telling <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine, "I was a geek, a spaz. I was horribly, painfully, terribly shy. At the same time, I was the guy who'd yell out funny captions during filmstrips. But I didn't get into trouble. I was always a real good kid and pretty responsible." Hanks acted in school plays, including <i>South Pacific</i>, while attending Skyline High School in Oakland, California.</p>

<p>Hanks studied theater at Chabot College in Hayward, California, and transferred to California State University, Sacramento after two years. During a 2001 interview with sportscaster Bob Costas, Hanks was asked whether he would rather have an Oscar or a Heisman Trophy. He replied he would rather win a Heisman by playing halfback for the California Golden Bears. He told <i>New York</i> magazine in 1986, "Acting classes looked like the best place for a guy who liked to make a lot of noise and be rather flamboyant. I spent a lot of time going to plays. I wouldn't take dates with me. I'd just drive to a theater, buy myself a ticket, sit in the seat and read the program, and then get into the play completely. I spent a lot of time like that, seeing Brecht, Tennessee Williams, Ibsen, and all that."</p>

<p>During his years studying theater, Hanks met Vincent Dowling, head of the Great Lakes Theater Festival in Cleveland, Ohio. At Dowling's suggestion, Hanks became an intern at the festival. His internship stretched into a three-year experience that covered most aspects of theater production, including lighting, set design, and stage management, prompting Hanks to drop out of college. During the same time, Hanks won the Cleveland Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his 1978 performance as Proteus in Shakespeare's <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, one of the few times he played a villain. In 2010, <i>Time</i> magazine named Hanks one of the "Top 10 College Dropouts."</p>

<h3>1980s: Early work</h3>

<p>In 1979, Hanks moved to New York City, where he made his film debut in the low-budget slasher film <i>He Knows You're Alone</i> (1980) and landed a starring role in the television movie <i>Mazes and Monsters</i>. Early that year, he was cast as the lead, Callimaco, in the Riverside Shakespeare Company's production of Niccolò Machiavelli's <i>The Mandrake</i>, directed by Daniel Southern. The following year, Hanks landed one of the lead roles, that of character Kip Wilson, on the ABC television pilot of <i>Bosom Buddies</i>. He and Peter Scolari played a pair of young advertising men forced to dress as women so they could live in an inexpensive all-female hotel. Hanks had previously partnered with Scolari on the 1970s game show <i>Make Me Laugh</i>. After landing the role, Hanks moved to Los Angeles. <i>Bosom Buddies</i> ran for two seasons, and, although the ratings were never strong, television critics gave the program high marks. "The first day I saw him on the set," co-producer Ian Praiser told <i>Rolling Stone</i>, "I thought, 'Too bad he won't be in television for long.' I knew he'd be a movie star in two years."</p>

<p>Hanks made a guest appearance on a 1982 episode of <i>Happy Days</i> ("A Case of Revenge," in which he played a disgruntled former classmate of Fonzie) where he met writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel who were also writing the film <i>Splash</i> (1984), a romantic comedy fantasy about a mermaid who falls in love with a human, to be directed by former <i>Happy Days</i> star Ron Howard. Ganz and Mandel suggested Howard consider Hanks for the film. At first, Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, a role that eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role in <i>Splash</i>, which went on to become a surprise box office hit, grossing more than US$69million. He also had a sizable hit with the sex comedy <i>Bachelor Party</i>, also in 1984. In 1983–84, Hanks made three guest appearances on <i>Family Ties</i> as Elyse Keaton's alcoholic brother Ned Donnelly.</p>

<p>With <i>Nothing in Common</i> (1986)—a story of a young man alienated from his father (played by Jackie Gleason)—Hanks began to extend himself from comedic roles to dramatic roles. In an interview with <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine, Hanks commented on his experience: "It changed my desires about working in movies. Part of it was the nature of the material, what we were trying to say. But besides that, it focused on people's relationships. The story was about a guy and his father, unlike, say, <i>The Money Pit</i>, where the story is really about a guy and his house." In 1987, he had signed an agreement with The Walt Disney Studios where he had starred to a talent pool in an acting/producing pact. After a few more flops and a moderate success with the comedy <i>Dragnet</i>, Hanks' stature in the film industry rose.</p>

<p>The broad success of the fantasy comedy <i>Big</i> (1988) established Hanks as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. <i>Big</i> was followed later that year by <i>Punchline</i>, in which he and Sally Field co-starred as struggling comedians.</p>

<p>Hanks then suffered a run of box-office underperformers: <i>The 'Burbs</i> (1989), <i>Joe Versus the Volcano</i> (1990), and <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i> (1990). In the last, he portrayed a greedy Wall Street figure who gets enmeshed in a hit-and-run accident. 1989's <i>Turner &amp; Hooch</i> was Hanks' only financially successful film of the period.</p>

<h3>1990s: Established star</h3>

<p>Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in <i>A League of Their Own</i> (1992). Hanks has said his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with <i>Vanity Fair</i>, Hanks noted his "modern era of moviemaking... because enough self-discovery has gone on... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top". This "modern era" began in 1993 for Hanks, first with <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i> and then with <i>Philadelphia</i>. The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of <i>TIME</i> called his performance "charming," and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.</p>

<p>In <i>Philadelphia</i>, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds (16kg) and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for <i>People</i>, Leah Rozen stated, "Above all, credit for <i>Philadelphia</i>'s success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar." Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in <i>Philadelphia</i>. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.</p>

<p>Hanks followed <i>Philadelphia</i> with the 1994 hit <i>Forrest Gump</i> which grossed a worldwide total of over $600million at the box office. Hanks remarked: "When I read the script for <i>Gump</i>, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel... some hope for their lot and their position in life... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do." Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in <i>Forrest Gump</i>, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars. (Spencer Tracy was the first, winning in 1937–38. Hanks and Tracy were the same age at the time they received their Academy Awards: 37 for the first and 38 for the second.)</p>

<p>Hanks' next role as astronaut and commander Jim Lovell in the 1995 film <i>Apollo 13</i> reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar's CGI-animated hit film <i>Toy Story</i>, as the voice of Sheriff Woody.</p>

<p>Hanks made his directing debut with his 1996 film <i>That Thing You Do!</i> about a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer. Hanks and producer Gary Goetzman went on to create Playtone, a record and film production company named after the record company in the film.</p>

<p>Hanks then executive produced, co-wrote, and co-directed the HBO docudrama <i>From the Earth to the Moon</i>. The 12-part series chronicled the space program from its inception, through the familiar flights of Neil Armstrong and Jim Lovell, to the personal feelings surrounding the reality of Moon landings. The Emmy Award-winning project was, at US$68million, one of the most expensive ventures undertaken for television.</p>

<p>In 1998, Hanks' next project was no less expensive. For <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, he teamed up with Steven Spielberg to make a film about a search through war-torn France after D-Day to bring back a soldier. It earned the praise and respect of the film community, critics, and the general public. It was labeled one of the finest war films ever made and earned Spielberg his second Academy Award for direction, and Hanks another Best Actor nomination. Later that year, Hanks re-teamed with his <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i> co-star Meg Ryan for <i>You've Got Mail</i>, a remake of 1940's <i>The Shop Around the Corner</i>. In 1999, Hanks starred in an adaptation of the Stephen King novel <i>The Green Mile</i>. He also returned as the voice of Woody in <i>Toy Story 2</i>, the sequel to <i>Toy Story</i>.</p>

<h3>2000s</h3>
<p>In 2000, Hanks starred in Robert Zemeckis's <i>Cast Away</i>, for which he received a Golden Globe Award win for Best Actor and an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of a marooned FedEx systems analyst. Famed critic Roger Ebert of <i>The Chicago Sun-Times</i> wrote of Hanks' performance "Hanks proves here again what an effective actor he is, never straining for an effect, always persuasive even in this unlikely situation, winning our sympathy with his eyes and his body language when there's no one else on the screen."</p>

<p>In 2001, Hanks helped direct and produce the Emmy Award-winning HBO miniseries <i>Band of Brothers</i>. He also appeared in the September 11 television special <i>America: A Tribute to Heroes</i> and the documentary <i>Rescued From the Closet</i>. He then teamed up with <i>American Beauty</i> director Sam Mendes for the adaptation of Max Allan Collins's and Richard Piers Rayner's DC Comics graphic novel <i>Road to Perdition</i>, in which he played an anti-hero role as a hitman on the run with his son. That same year, Hanks collaborated once again with director Spielberg, starring opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in the hit biographical crime drama <i>Catch Me If You Can</i>, based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. The same year, Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson produced the hit movie <i>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</i>. In August 2007, he along with co-producers Rita Wilson and Gary Goetzman, and writer and star Nia Vardalos, initiated a legal action against the production company Gold Circle Films for their share of profits from the movie. At the age of 45, Hanks became the youngest-ever recipient of the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award on June 12, 2002.</p>

<p>In 2004, he appeared in three films: The Coen brothers' <i>The Ladykillers</i>, another Spielberg film, <i>The Terminal</i>, and <i>The Polar Express</i>, a family film from Zemeckis for which Hanks played multiple motion capture roles. In a <i>USA Weekend</i> interview, Hanks discussed how he chooses projects: "[Since] <i>A League of Their Own</i>, it can't be just another movie for me. It has to get me going somehow... There has to be some all-encompassing desire or feeling about wanting to do that particular movie. I'd like to assume that I'm willing to go down any avenue in order to do it right". In August 2005, Hanks was voted in as vice president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p>

<p>Hanks next starred in the highly anticipated film <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, based on the bestselling novel by Dan Brown. The film was released May 19, 2006 in the U.S., and grossed over US$750million worldwide. He followed the film with Ken Burns's 2007 documentary <i>The War</i>. For the documentary, Hanks did voice work, reading excerpts from World War II-era columns by Al McIntosh. In 2006, Hanks topped a 1,500-strong list of "most trusted celebrities" compiled by <i>Forbes</i> magazine. Hanks also produced the animated children's movie <i>The Ant Bully</i> in 2006.</p>

<p>Hanks next appeared in a cameo role as himself in <i>The Simpsons Movie</i>, in which he appeared in an advertisement claiming that the U.S. government has lost its credibility and is hence buying some of his. He also made an appearance in the credits, expressing a desire to be left alone when he is out in public. Later in 2006, Hanks produced the British film <i>Starter for Ten</i>, a comedy based on working-class students attempting to win on <i>University Challenge</i>.</p>

<p>In 2007, Hanks starred in Mike Nichols's film <i>Charlie Wilson's War</i> (written by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin) in which he played Democratic Texas Congressman Charles Wilson. The film opened on December 21, 2007, and Hanks received a Golden Globe nomination. In the comedy-drama film <i>The Great Buck Howard</i> (2008), Hanks played the on-screen father of a young man (played by Hanks' real-life son Colin) who chooses to work as road manager for a fading mentalist (John Malkovich). His character was less than thrilled about his son's career decision. In the same year, he executive produced the musical comedy <i>Mamma Mia</i> and the miniseries <i>John Adams</i>.</p>

<p>Hanks' next endeavor, released on May 15, 2009, was a film adaptation of <i>Angels &amp; Demons</i>, based on the novel of the same name by Dan Brown. Its April 11, 2007 announcement revealed that Hanks would reprise his role as Robert Langdon, and that he would reportedly receive the highest salary ever for an actor. The following day he made his 10th appearance on NBC's <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, impersonating himself for the <i>Celebrity Jeopardy</i> sketch.

<h3>2010s</h3>
<p>In 2010, Hanks reprised his voice role of Woody in <i>Toy Story 3</i> after he, Tim Allen, and John Ratzenberger were invited to a movie theater to see a complete story reel of the movie.

<p>In 2013, Hanks starred in two critically acclaimed films—<i>Captain Phillips </i>and<i> Saving Mr. Banks—</i>which each earned him praise, including nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama for the former role. In <i>Captain Phillips</i>, he starred as Captain Richard Phillips with Barkhad Abdi, which was based on the Maersk Alabama hijacking.

<p>In 2014, Hanks' short story "Alan Bean Plus Four" was published in the October 27 issue of <i>The New Yorker</i>. Revolving around four friends who make a voyage to the moon, the short story is titled after the Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean. <i>Slate</i> magazine's Katy Waldman found his first published short story "mediocre", writing that "Hanks' shopworn ideas about technology might have yet sung if they hadn't been wrapped in too-clever lit mag-ese". In an interview with <i>The New Yorker</i>, Hanks said he has always been fascinated by space. He told the magazine that he built plastic models of rockets when he was a child and watched live broadcasts of space missions back in the 1960s.</p>

<p>In March 2015, Hanks appeared in the Carly Rae Jepsen music video for "I Really Like You", lip-syncing most of the song's lyrics as he goes through his daily routine.

Donovan who negotiated for the release of pilot Francis Gary Powers by the Soviet Union in exchange for KGB spy Rudolf Abel. It was released in October 2015 to a positive reception.

<p>On April 11, 2020, Hanks made his first television appearance since his COVID-19 diagnosis by hosting <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. Hanks delivered an opening monologue via his house but did not appear in any of the sketches. This is the first episode of <i>SNL</i> to debut after the show's hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it features different sketches filmed remotely from the cast members' homes. This is also a first in <i>SNL</i> history, for the show to be made up entirely of prerecorded content before airing, and the second to not be filmed at Studio 8H.</p>

<p>Hanks had two films released in 2020. In July 2020, Hanks starred in <i>Greyhound</i>, a war film which he also wrote the screenplay for. Initially set to be theatrically released in June 2020 by Sony Pictures, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, distribution rights to the film were bought by Apple TV+, where it was released in July 2020. Later that year, Hanks starred in the western drama film <i>News of the World</i>, re-teaming with director Paul Greengrass, which was released on December 23, 2020. Film critic David Rooney of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> praised Hanks' performance in his review writing, "Hanks has built a career out of playing thoroughly decent men, so his casting here is entirely to type. But the soulfulness and sorrow, the innate compassion that ripple through his characterization make this an enormously pleasurable performance to watch, with new depths of both kindness and regret that keep revealing themselves."</p>

<p>In 2021, Hanks starred in the science fiction drama <i>Finch</i>, directed by Miguel Sapochnik, and released by Apple TV+. On March 2, 2022, Connor Ratliff appeared as a guest on <i>Late Night With Seth Meyers,</i> where he revealed that Hanks would at last be interviewed for the season three finale of Ratliff's podcast <i>Dead Eyes</i>. The conversation between Hanks and Ratliff took place 22 years after Ratliff was about to begin filming an episode of <i>Band of Brothers</i>, when he was subsequently fired, allegedly because Hanks believed Ratliff had "dead eyes". The 90 minute interview was hailed as a momentous achievement in podcasting, a "rare show that gives you a perfect conclusion", "surprisingly funny and empathetic", and an event Paul Scheer called "thrilling".</p>

<p>Hanks had three films released in 2022.  He first starred as Tom Parker, the sole manager of Elvis Presley, in <i>Elvis</i>, directed by Baz Luhrmann. Shooting commenced in the beginning of 2020 in Queensland, Australia, and the film was released in June 2022. Hanks next film was portraying Geppetto in Walt Disney Studios' live-action adaptation of <i>Pinocchio</i>. His involvement in the film, which was directed by his longtime collaborator Zemeckis, was officially confirmed in December 2020, and released on September 8, 2022 by Disney+. Hanks' final film of the year was <i>A Man Called Otto</i>, an English-language remake of the Swedish film <i>A Man Called Ove</i>. It was released by Sony Pictures in December 2022.</p>

<p>In 2023, Hanks appeared in Wes Anderson's <i>Asteroid City</i>, their first collaboration. First announced in July 2021, he starred alongside Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson, Adrien Brody, Jeffrey Wright, and Bryan Cranston. The film premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival to mixed reviews, and was released in June 2023.</p>

<p>HBO confirmed in January 2013 that it was developing a third World War II miniseries based on the book <i>Masters of the Air</i> by Donald L. Miller with Hanks and Spielberg to follow <i>Band of Brothers</i> and <i>The Pacific</i>. Few details have emerged about the project since, but <i>NME</i> reported in March 2017 that production was progressing under the working title <i>The Mighty Eighth</i>. On October 11, 2019, it was announced that the series would keep the title from the book and that the miniseries will stream on Apple TV+ due to budget constraints at HBO. <i>Masters of the Air</i> is expected to cost $200 million with a duration of at least eight hours.</p>

<p>Hanks is also appearing in <i>In the Garden of Beasts</i>, an adaptation of the 2011 non fiction book from director Joe Wright about American diplomat William Dodd. In February 2022, it was announced that Hanks will star in the feature adaptation of <i>Here</i>, a graphic novel by Richard McGuire, directed by Robert Zemeckis.</p>

<h2>Personal life</h2>

<p>Hanks married American actress Samantha Lewes (1952–2002) in 1978. They had one son, actor Colin (b. 1977), and one daughter, Elizabeth (b. 1982). Hanks and Lewes divorced in 1987. Lewes died in 2002 at the age of 49 from bone cancer.</p>

<p>In 1981, Hanks met actress Rita Wilson on the set of TV comedy <i>Bosom Buddies</i> (1980–1982). They were reunited in 1985 on the set of <i>Volunteers</i>. Wilson is of Greek and Bulgarian descent, and a member of the Greek Orthodox Church. Before marrying her, Hanks converted to her faith. Hanks and Wilson married in 1988 and have two sons. The older, Chet, released a rap song in 2011 and had recurring roles in <i>Empire</i> and <i>Shameless</i>. Their younger, Truman, was born in 1995, and portrayed the younger version of his father's character in <i>A Man Called Otto</i> (2022). Hanks lives with his family in Los Angeles, California, and Ketchum, Idaho.</p>

<p>Hanks actively attends church. He said, "I must say that when I go to church—and I do go to church—I ponder the mystery. I meditate on the 'why?' of 'why people are as they are' and 'why bad things happen to good people,' and 'why good things happen to bad people'[...] The mystery is what I think is, almost, the grand unifying theory of all mankind."</p>

<p>In October 2013, Hanks said he has Type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>Despite being a fan of the Oakland Athletics and the Raiders when they were based in Oakland, Hanks stated in April 2017 he would boycott the NFL for two years after the Raiders filed for relocation to Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Since 1984, Hanks has been an avid fan of the English Premier League club Aston Villa.</p>

<p>In November 2019, shortly before the release of <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i>, a drama film in which Hanks portrays Fred Rogers, he learned through Ancestry.com that he and Rogers were sixth cousins, both descendants of Johannes Meffert (1732–1795), who was born in Schöneck, Hesse, Germany (then part of the Holy Roman Empire) and immigrated to the United States in the 18th century, settling in Kentucky and changing his last name to Mefford.</p>

<p>Hanks is also a distant relative of the 16th US president, Abraham Lincoln. Hanks narrated the 2011 television program <i>Killing Lincoln</i>.</p>

<p>On December 27, 2019, the President of Greece, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, signed an honorary naturalization order for Hanks and his family, citing their "exceptional services to Greece", thus making him and his immediate family Greek citizens. Hanks, along with Wilson and their children, were conferred honorary citizenship for their role in bringing global attention and appealing for aid after a devastating wildfire that ripped through the seaside village of Mati, near Athens, in July 2018, which killed more than 100 people. Greece's Interior Minister Takis Theodorikakos said Hanks "showed real interest in the people who suffered from the fire in Mati and promoted this issue in the global media".</p>

<p>On July 26, 2020, the Prime Minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, accompanied with his wife, handed over Greek passports to both Hanks and Wilson.</p>

<p>Hanks has donated to many Democratic politicians, and during the 2008 United States presidential election uploaded a video to his MySpace account endorsing Barack Obama. He also narrated a 2012 documentary, <i>The Road We've Traveled,</i> created by Obama for America. In 2016, Hanks endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p>Hanks was outspoken about his opposition to the 2008 Proposition8, an amendment to the California constitution that defined marriage as a union only between a man and a woman. Hanks and others raised over US$44million to campaign against the proposition, in contrast to the supporters' $39million, but Proposition8 passed with 52% of the vote. It was overruled in June 2013, when the Ninth Circuit lifted its stay of the district court's ruling, enabling Governor Jerry Brown to order same-sex marriage officiations to resume. While premiering a TV series in January 2009, Hanks called supporters of Proposition8 "un-American" and criticized LDS Church members, who were major proponents of the bill, for their views on marriage and role in supporting the bill. About a week later, he apologized for the remark, saying that nothing is more American than voting one's conscience.</p>

<p>A proponent of environmentalism, Hanks is an investor in electric vehicles and owns a Toyota RAV4 EV and the first production AC Propulsion eBox. He was a lessee of an EV1 before it was recalled, as chronicled in the documentary <i>Who Killed the Electric Car?</i> He was on the waiting list for an Aptera2 Series.</p>

<p>Hanks serves as campaign chair of the Hidden Heroes Campaign of the Elizabeth Dole Foundation. The stated mission of the campaign is to inspire a national movement to more effectively support the military and veteran caregivers.</p>

<p>In 2004, while touring the White House, Hanks learned that the press corps did not have a coffee pot, and shortly thereafter he donated an espresso machine. He again donated new machines in 2010 and 2017. His 2017 donation was accompanied by a note that read "To the White House Press Corps, Keep up the good fight for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. Especially for the truth part."</p>

<p>He endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.</p>

<p>A supporter of NASA's crewed space program, Hanks said he originally wanted to be an astronaut. Hanks is a member of the National Space Society, serving on the Board of governors of the nonprofit educational space advocacy organization founded by Wernher von Braun. He also produced the HBO miniseries <i>From the Earth to the Moon</i> about the Apollo program to send astronauts to the Moon.

In addition to his role in <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, Hanks was cited for serving as the national spokesperson for the World War II Memorial Campaign, for being the honorary chairperson of the D-Day Museum Capital Campaign, and for his role in writing and helping to produce the Emmy Award-winning miniseries, <i>Band of Brothers</i>. On March 10, 2008, Hanks was on hand at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to induct The Dave Clark Five.</p>
