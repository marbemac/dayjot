<p><i><b>Young Sheldon</b></i> is an American coming-of-age sitcom television series created by Chuck Lorre and Steven Molaro for CBS. The series, set in the late 1980s and early 1990s, is a spin-off prequel to <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> and follows main character Sheldon Cooper growing up with his family in East Texas. Iain Armitage stars as young Sheldon, alongside Zoe Perry, Lance Barber, Montana Jordan, Raegan Revord, and Annie Potts. Jim Parsons, who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, narrates the series and is also an executive producer.</p>

<p>Development of the prequel series began in November 2016, from an initial idea that Parsons passed along to <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> producers. The following March, Armitage and Perry were cast, and the series was ordered by CBS. <i>Young Sheldon</i> premiered as a special preview on September 25, 2017, and was picked up for a full season that began airing weekly from November 2, 2017. In March 2021, CBS renewed the series through to a seventh season.</p>



<h2>Premise</h2>
<p>The series, which begins in the fall of 1989, follows Sheldon Cooper's early life as a child prodigy in the fictional town of Medford, Texas. As he grows up, he tries to fit into a world of people, including his own family and friends, who struggle to cope with his unusual intellectual capabilities and social ineptitude. Many episodes reference historic or pop cultural events from the early 1990s, some of which are unique to the US.</p>



<h2>Cast and characters</h2>
<div>Main article: List of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> and <i>Young Sheldon</i> characters</div>

<h3>Main</h3>
<ul><li>Iain Armitage as Sheldon Lee Cooper, a child prodigy well-versed in various branches of mathematics and science. He states that he decided to pursue physics around the same time as the show began. While academically gifted, Sheldon lacks a full understanding of social cues, and his superior intellect gives him a sense of superiority over everyone which often leads to him being obnoxious and rude, while being completely oblivious of the effect upon other people, including his family. Nevertheless, Sheldon has proven to love his family and almost always has his heart in the right place. He is Georgie's younger brother and Missy’s fraternal older twin brother. He begins attending high school at age 9 and college full time at age 11. Armitage appears as part of videotaped footage playing the character in <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> through an episode in the final season.
<ul><li>Jim Parsons is the voice of adult Sheldon Cooper, who provides the perspective of an adult recalling his childhood.</li></ul></li>

<li>Zoe Perry as Mary Cooper (née Tucker), mother of Sheldon, Missy, and Georgie. She is very overprotective and can be controlling at times. Though she is strict with her kids, she is harder with Missy and Georgie. She tends to worry a lot about her kids because she went through a rough path herself. She is a devout Southern Baptist, working at her local church, and sometimes objects to Sheldon's atheism. Nevertheless, she deeply loves her son and wants to protect him for as long as she can. Perry's mother, Laurie Metcalf, played Mary on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>.</li>
<li>Lance Barber as George Cooper Sr., Sheldon, Missy, and Georgie's father; a Vietnam veteran; and the head football coach at Medford High. George does not share Sheldon's intellect, which sometimes leads others, especially Meemaw, to doubt his genetic relationship to Sheldon. He is often at odds with his children and particularly struggles to understand Sheldon, but he does try to be a caring and responsible father. In <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, it is stated that George Cooper Sr. will die when Sheldon is 14 years old in 1994. Barber appeared in a Season 5 episode of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> as one of adult Sheldon's future roommate Leonard Hofstadter's high school bullies, Jimmy Speckerman, before making an appearance via a 1990s videotape as his <i>Young Sheldon</i> character in a final season episode.</li>
<li>Montana Jordan as George Marshall "Georgie" Cooper Jr., Sheldon and Missy's older brother. Georgie resents the attention his parents especially his mother pay to Sheldon. He does not do well at school and gets mocked and teased for it by the rest of the family, particularly Sheldon and Meemaw. He does not get along well with Sheldon because he's tired of always being compared. He attends Medford High with Sheldon and plays on the school's football team. At age 17, he drops out of school to work full-time and discovers a talent for sales that will lead him to become the wealthy owner of a tire store chain in <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, on which he is played by Jerry O'Connell.</li>
<li>Raegan Revord as Melissa "Missy" Cooper, Georgie's younger sister and Sheldon's younger twin sister. She teases Sheldon along with Georgie but not as much. She does not share Sheldon's intelligence, but is very perceptive. Occasionally, she does not get along with Sheldon, but she finds in her twin brother a solid confidant and has admitted to not feeling as whole without him. She also shows love for her brother even though she constantly denies it. Courtney Henggeler plays adult Missy in <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>.</li>

<li>Annie Potts as Constance "Connie" Tucker, Sheldon, Missy, and Georgie's maternal grandmother, whom they refer to as "Meemaw". She is a fun-loving woman who can be sarcastic and often mocks those around her, especially George. On the other hand, she is patient with and sometimes struggles to understand Sheldon, whom she affectionately calls 'Moonpie', and advises Mary to trust that Sheldon will find his way. In the fourth season, she is said to be 68 years old. June Squibb plays old Connie in <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>.</li>
<li>Matt Hobby as Pastor Jeff Difford (season 3–present; recurring seasons 1–2), the upbeat pastor at the Cooper family's Baptist church. Like Mary, he too sometimes has friction with Sheldon's irreligious side and often challenges Sheldon to explore their line of thought through logic exercises.</li>
<li>Wyatt McClure as William "Billy" Sparks (season 5–present; recurring seasons 1–4), the son of Cooper family neighbors Herschel and Brenda, who, his mother implies, may not attend college due to his seeming lack of intelligence. The pilot episode depicts him as Sheldon's nemesis, but he becomes much friendlier early in the series. He has an unrequited crush on Missy.</li>

<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>In November 2016, it was reported that CBS was in negotiations to create a spin-off of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> centered on Sheldon Cooper as a young boy. The prequel series, described as "a <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i>-esque single-camera family comedy" would be executive produced by <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> co-creator Chuck Lorre and producer Steven Molaro, with <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> co-creator Bill Prady expected to be involved in some capacity, and intended to air in the 2017–18 season alongside <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. The initial idea for the series came from Jim Parsons (who portrays the adult Sheldon on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>), who passed it along to <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> producers. On March 13, 2017, CBS ordered the spin-off <i>Young Sheldon</i> series, which was created by Lorre and Molaro. Jon Favreau directed and executive produced the pilot. Parsons, Lorre, Molaro and Todd Spiewak also serve as executive producers on the series, for Chuck Lorre Productions and Warner Bros. Television. On September 27, 2017, CBS picked up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. On January 6, 2018, the show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on September 24 of that same year.</p>

<p>On February 22, 2019, CBS renewed the series for both a third and a fourth season. The third season premiered on September 26, 2019. Warner Bros. Television suspended production on March 13, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving the third season with only 21 episodes. Production for the fourth season began on September 22, 2020 and premiered on November 5, 2020. Production for the fourth season concluded on March 15, 2021.</p>

<p>On March 30, 2021, CBS renewed the series for a fifth, sixth, and seventh season. The fifth season premiered on October 7, 2021. The sixth season premiered on September 29, 2022.</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<p>In early March 2017, Iain Armitage was cast as the younger Sheldon, and Zoe Perry as his mother, Mary Cooper. Perry is the real-life daughter of Laurie Metcalf, who portrays Mary Cooper on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. Lance Barber stars as George Cooper Sr., Sheldon's father; he had previously appeared in one episode of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. Raegan Revord stars as Missy Cooper, Sheldon's twin sister; Revord only got the part after repeatedly asking her mother to be allowed to read for the role. The show also stars Montana Jordan as George Cooper Jr., Sheldon's older brother. Jim Parsons reprises his role as adult Sheldon Cooper, as narrator for the series. In July 2017, Annie Potts was cast as Meemaw, Sheldon's grandmother.</p>

<h3>Overlap with the parent series</h3>
<p>In most cases different actors are used to portray a given character in the two series, to account for the age difference. Jim Parsons is a notable exception in that he appears in both series as the same character, though in this series his appearance is limited to voice only. In the Season 4 episode "Graduation", Mayim Bialik (as Amy, the wife of adult Sheldon) has a brief voice-over role while Sheldon describes the graduation party for their son Leonard, whom he reveals was named after Leonard Hofstadter and Leonard Nimoy. Bob Newhart appears as Professor Proton in both series; with the appearance in this series, the character is made to look younger. Iain Armitage (Sheldon), Lance Barber (George), and Montana Jordan (Georgie) make a guest appearance in the parent series in a scene in which a VHS tape recorded decades earlier is played. There are other actors who appear in both series but as different characters. This includes Barber, who had another guest appearance in the parent series as a different character, and Kaley Cuoco who stars in the parent series and makes an uncredited voice appearance in this series, voicing an inanimate object. Elon Musk has cameos as himself in both series, appearing in season 1 episode 6 of <i>Young Sheldon</i>.</p>

<p>The second-season finale episode aired immediately following the one-hour series finale of the parent series. In a tribute to the parent series finale, several references are made to it in the <i>Young Sheldon</i> episode. The references are both general to the entire parent series, as well as to the series finale in particular. In one scene in the <i>Young Sheldon</i> episode, Sheldon promises his father that when he wins the Nobel Prize, Sheldon will mention him in his acceptance speech. In the parent series finale, Sheldon wins the Nobel Prize, and he does mention his father (among others) in the acceptance speech. In another scene in the <i>Young Sheldon</i> episode, Nobel Prize winners are announced out over a montage showing the main characters from the parent series Leonard, Penny, Raj, Howard, Bernadette, and Amy as children. Christine Baranski and Carol Ann Susi, who respectively portray Leonard's mother and Howard's mother in the parent series, make a voice appearance in the montage (a posthumous appearance in the case of Susi). Following the montage, adult Sheldon says that he was wrong about feeling at the moment of the Nobel prize announcement that he would be all alone for the rest of his life.</p>



<h2>Title sequence</h2>
<p>The show's title sequence is played to Steve Burns' "Mighty Little Man", the first track from his 2003 album <i>Songs for Dustmites</i>. The background in the first two seasons shows mountains and a desert, whilst the foreground has Sheldon (usually in bow tie, checked shirt, shorts and cowboy boots) walking out, standing triumphantly, noticing a cow, and backing away from it before resuming his triumphant look as the logo appears and tilts to the sky. Occasionally, a tumbleweed appears, instead of the cow. The title sequence was changed from Season 3 onwards to include the entire Cooper family, as well as showing Sheldon in different costumes, such as Albert Einstein, Mr. Spock, The Flash, an astronaut, and a train engineer. Season 5 features a black bull in place of the cow.</p>
