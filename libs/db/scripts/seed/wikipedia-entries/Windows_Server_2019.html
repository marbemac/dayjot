<h1>Windows Server 2019</h1>

<div>Ninth version of Windows Server, released in 2018</div>



<p><b>Windows Server 2019</b> is the ninth version of the Windows Server operating system by Microsoft, as part of the Windows NT family of operating systems. It is the second version of the server operating system based on the Windows 10 platform, after Windows Server 2016. It was announced on March 20, 2018 for the first Windows Insider preview release, and was released internationally on October 2, 2018. It was succeeded by Windows Server 2022 on August 18, 2021.</p>



<h2>Development and release</h2>
<p>Windows Server 2019 was announced on March 20, 2018, and the first Windows Insider preview version was released on the same day. It was released for general availability on October 2 of the same year.</p>

<p>On October 6, 2018, distribution of Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763) was paused while Microsoft investigated an issue with user data being deleted during an in-place upgrade. It affected systems where a user profile folder (e.g. Documents, Music or Pictures) had been moved to another location, but data was left in the original location. As Windows Server 2019 is based on the Windows version 1809 codebase, it too was removed from distribution at the time, but was re-released on November 13, 2018. The software product life cycle for Server 2019 was reset in accordance with the new release date.</p>

<h3>Web browser</h3>
<p>Microsoft Edge did not support Server 2019 at release. Microsoft considers Internet Explorer 11 a "compatibility layer," not a browser.  Edge added support in January 2020, but Server 2019 does not install it by default.  Microsoft encourages server and enterprise users to install Edge.</p>
