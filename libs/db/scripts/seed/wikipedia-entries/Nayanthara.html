She was spotted by director Sathyan Anthikkad, who had seen some of her modelling assignments and approached her to play a pivotal role in his film <i>Manassinakkare</i> (2003).

All three films opened to mixed reviews. In <i>Vallavan</i>, she portrayed a lecturer who falls in love with a student younger than her.

Her performance in <i>Billa</i> earned her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Tamil, in addition to winning the Vijay Award for Favourite Heroine.
