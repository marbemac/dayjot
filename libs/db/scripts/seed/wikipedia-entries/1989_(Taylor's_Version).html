<p>Taylor Swift released her fifth studio album, <i>1989</i>, on October 27, 2014, under Big Machine Records. Inspired by 1980s synth-pop, Swift conceived <i>1989</i> to recalibrate her artistry to pop after marketing her first four albums to country radio. The album was a critical and commercial success, receiving positive reviews from music critics and selling over 1.287 million copies within its first week in the United States. Three of its singles—"Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood"—reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Swift became the first artist to have three albums each sell one million copies within the first week, <i>1989</i> was the first album released in 2014 to exceed one million copies, and topped the <i>Billboard</i> 200 for 11 non-consecutive weeks. At the 58th Annual Grammy Awards (2016), the album won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, making Swift the first female artist to win the former two times.</p>

<p>Swift released her next studio album, <i>Reputation</i> (2017), under Big Machine, as per her recording contract, which expired in November 2018. She hence withdrew from Big Machine and signed a new deal with Republic Records, which secured her the rights to own the masters of any new music she would release. In 2019, American businessman Scooter Braun acquired Big Machine; the ownership of the masters to Swift's first six studio albums, including <i>1989</i>, transferred to him. In August 2019, Swift denounced Braun's purchase and announced that she would re-record her first six studio albums so as to own their masters herself. Swift began the re-recording process in November 2020. <i>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</i>, the first of her six re-recorded albums, was released on April 9, 2021, followed by <i>Red (Taylor's Version)</i> on November 12, 2021, and <i>Speak Now (Taylor's Version)</i> on July 7, 2023; all three achieved critical and commercial success, debuting atop the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart.</p>

<p>Swift began teasing <i>1989 (Taylor's Version)</i> with "Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)", released on September 17, 2021, amid a viral TikTok trend involving the original 2014 recording of the song. "This Love (Taylor's Version)" was released on digital platforms on May 6, 2022. A snippet of "Bad Blood (Taylor's Version)" was featured in the 2022 animated film <i>DC League of Super-Pets</i>. The 2023 music video for "I Can See You" had several Easter eggs hinting at the re-record of <i>1989</i>. Several hints to the imminent announcement were noticed by fans while Swift performed at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood as part of her sixth concert tour, the Eras Tour, on August 8, 2023, including several of Swift's outfits changing to a blue color, and fans' LED wristbands flashing blue five times.</p>

<p>On August 9, 2023, at her final show at SoFi Stadium, Swift announced <i>1989 (Taylor's Version)</i> as her next re-recorded album, set for release on October 27, 2023, exactly nine years after the original release of <i>1989</i>. SoFi Stadium illuminated its roof with the album title following the announcement.</p>



<h2>Promotion and release</h2>
<p><i>1989 (Taylor's Version)</i> is scheduled for release on October 27, 2023, to music streaming services and in vinyl LP, cassette tape, and CD formats. It marks Swift's fourth re-recorded album. The standard edition contains 21 tracks, five of which are designated "From the Vault", indicating unreleased songs that were written for <i>1989</i> but did not make the final track list in 2014. The album will be sold in four CD editions, which featured different artworks and either posters or photographs, as well as five vinyl variants, one of which is a Target-exclusive deluxe that also includes "Sweeter than Fiction (Taylor's Version)."</p>

<p>On September 19, 2023, Swift posted a short visual on social media that depicted the characters "T-S-!-U-L" emerging from a blue vault, which fans and journalists considered to be a teaser for one of the five "From the Vault" tracks. She also partnered with Google Search to launch a feature for solving word puzzles in order to uncover the album's "From the Vault" track titles. Searching for "Taylor Swift" gave rise to an animated graphic of a blue vault, which, upon clicking, produced one of 89 puzzles with or without an accompanying hint. The track titles were set to be officially revealed once 33 million puzzles had been solved globally. The feature crashed hours after launching. It reached the 33-million mark in less than a day, and four of the five vault track titles were revealed: "Is It Over Now?", "Now That We Don't Talk", "Say Don't Go", and "Suburban Legends". Shortly thereafter, Swift posted the back covers of the album, which featured the full tracklist, confirming "'Slut!'" as the other vault track.</p>
