<p><i><b>Yellowstone</b></i> is an American neo-Western drama television series created by Taylor Sheridan and John Linson that premiered on June 20, 2018, on Paramount Network. The series stars Kevin Costner, Luke Grimes, Kelly Reilly, Wes Bentley, Cole Hauser, Kelsey Asbille, and Gil Birmingham. The series follows the conflicts along the shared borders of the Yellowstone Ranch, a large cattle ranch, the Broken Rock Indian reservation, Yellowstone National Park and land developers. In May 2023, it was announced that the fifth season will be its last and will be followed by an untitled sequel series. The first part of the fifth and final season premiered on November 13, 2022, with the second part planned to premiere about a year later -- although the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike and creative tensions among the show's leadership have put that return in doubt.</p>

<p>In 2013, Sheridan began work on the series, having recently grown tired of acting and switching to screenwriting. Having lived in the rural parts of states such as Texas and Wyoming, Sheridan set the series in Montana and set the first scripts in Livingston. Sheridan initially pitched the series to HBO, but the network declined. The series follows the Dutton family, owners of the largest ranch in Montana, the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch, commonly called "the Yellowstone". The plot revolves around family drama at the ranch and the bordering Broken Rock Indian Reservation, Yellowstone National Park, and developers. In May 2017, Paramount Network announced that it had greenlit its first scripted series, <i>Yellowstone</i>. Paramount issued a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes. The series was set to be written, directed and executive-produced by Sheridan.</p>

<p>A prequel series titled <i>1883</i> (2021–2022) was announced following a five-year deal signed by Sheridan with ViacomCBS and MTV Entertainment Group. The series focuses on a generation of the Dutton family during the Old West as they undertake the arduous journey across the country before settling the land that would become the Yellowstone Ranch. A second prequel series titled <i>1923</i> (2022–present) focuses on an intervening generation of the Dutton family during the time of Western Expansion, Prohibition, and the Great Depression. A third planned spin-off titled <i>6666</i> is also in development and is set in the present day on the Four Sixes Ranch in Texas. A further fourth spin-off titled <i>1944</i> was confirmed by Paramount in early 2023.</p>

<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>In 2013, Taylor Sheridan began work on the series, having recently grown tired of acting and begun writing screenplays. Having lived in the rural parts of states such as Texas and Wyoming, Sheridan set the series in Montana and went about writing the first scripts in Livingston. He initially pitched the series to HBO, but the network declined.</p>

<p>In May 2017, Paramount Network announced that it had greenlit its first scripted series, <i>Yellowstone</i>. Paramount issued a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes. The series was set to be written, directed, and executive-produced by Sheridan. Other executive producers were to include John Linson, Art Linson, Harvey Weinstein, and David Glasser. Production companies involved with the series were set to consist of Linson Entertainment and The Weinstein Company.</p>

<p>In October 2017, it was announced that following reports of sexual abuse allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein, his name would be removed from the series' credits as would The Weinstein Company. In January 2018, Kevin Kay, president of Paramount Network, clarified during the annual Television Critics Association's winter press tour that <i>Yellowstone</i> will not have The Weinstein Company's credits or logo on them, even though that company was involved in production. He stated that their intent is to replace Weinstein Television with the company's new name in the show's credits when available. That same day, it was announced that the series would premiere on June 20, 2018.</p>

<p>In July 2018, it was announced that Paramount Network had renewed the series for a second season that was expected to premiere in 2019. In March 2019, it was announced that the second season would premiere on June 19, 2019. In June 2019, the series was renewed by Paramount for a third season, which premiered on June 21, 2020. In February 2020, Paramount Network renewed the series for a fourth season, ahead of the premiere of its third season. The fourth season premiered on November 7, 2021. In February 2022, Paramount Network renewed the series for a fifth season, which will be split into two installments. The fifth season premiered on November 13, 2022. In May 2023, Paramount announced that Costner would be leaving the series at the end of Part 2 of Season 5 presently scheduled to start airing in November 2023.</p>

<h3>Costume Designer</h3>
<p>In August 2017, Oscar-nominated costume designer Ruth E. Carter joined the production team, but soon departed at the end of the first season. Designer Johnetta Boone then joined the production crew for the start of the second season.</p>

<h3>Filming</h3>
<p>Principal photography for the series began in August 2017 at the Chief Joseph Ranch in Darby, Montana, which stands in as the home of John Dutton. Filming also took place that month near Park City, Utah. The production used all three soundstages at the Utah Film Studios in Park City, which is a total of 45,000 square feet. The building also houses offices, editing, a wardrobe department and construction shops. By November 2017, the series had filmed in more than twenty locations in Utah, including the Salt Flats, Promontory Club, and Spanish Fork. Additionally, filming also took place at various locations in Montana. Production reportedly lasted until December 2017.</p>

<p>In August 2020, the series announced that filming was completely moved to Montana. An undisclosed production location was rented in Missoula, Montana. Film locations included the Community Medical Center, Ryman Street near the County Courthouse, and a diner (Ruby's Cafe) on Brooks Street in Missoula, as well as places in nearby Hamilton, Montana.</p>

<p>Filming for season 5 started in June 2022 in Missoula. In July 2023, filming was put on an indefinite hold during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.</p>

<h4>John Dutton's "Log Mansion"</h4>
<img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Chief_Joseph_Ranch.jpg/220px-Chief_Joseph_Ranch.jpg" height="129" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Chief_Joseph_Ranch.jpg/330px-Chief_Joseph_Ranch.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Chief_Joseph_Ranch.jpg/440px-Chief_Joseph_Ranch.jpg 2x" />Chief Joseph Ranch in Darby, Montana.
<p>Filming of the "log mansion" home of John Dutton is at the main house of the Chief Joseph Ranch, which is now a guest ranch just south of Darby.</p>

<p>The house was built between 1914 and 1917 after Cincinnati, Ohio residents William S. Ford (1866–1935) and Howard Clark Hollister (1856–1919) purchased 2,500 acres on the Bitterroot River for a vacation home and formed the Ford-Hollister Ranch.    Ford was chairman of Owens-Illinois Glass in Toledo, Ohio.  Hollister was a judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  Bates &amp; Gamble of Toledo were the architects.  The house is 5,000 square feet including a 2,200 square foot parlor.</p>

<p>The house has a log cabin motif and was dubbed "log mansion" by <i>The New York Times</i>. It has been compared in style to the Old Faithful Inn which opened in 1904 and is 294 driving miles away in Yellowstone National Park.  The <i>Times</i> described it as "A diverse combination of arches, gables and dormers, set off by logs placed vertically and horizontally, adds an elegance to log-home design that is seldom seen."</p>

<p>The complex includes 3 large barns built to house Holstein cattle.  It was claimed it was the largest dairy herd west of the Mississippi River. Ford later gave up the dairy cattle and began raising Hereford cattle.  After Ford died, his wife and daughter operated it as a guest house.  They sold it in 1952.  It went through a series of new owners who renamed it for Chief Joseph who is said to have passed through its area during the Nez Perce War. Mel Pervais, a self-made millionaire and member of the Ojibwa Nation, owned it from 1987 to 2004.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>The series' score was composed by Brian Tyler. He worked with musicians from the London Philharmonia Orchestra and viola, cello, and violin soloists. On August 17, 2018, the soundtrack for the first season was released by Sony Music.</p>

<h3>Release</h3>
<p>A teaser trailer for the series was released on February 28, 2018, with the first full trailer being released on April 26. On June 25, 2018, the series held a screening at Seriesfest, an annual international television festival, at the Red Rocks Amphitheater near Denver, Colorado. The first season was released on Blu-ray and DVD on December 4, 2018 by Paramount Home Media Distribution (under the Paramount Network label). On July 17, 2023, following the SAG-AFTRA strike, CBS announced that edited episodes of the series would air on its Fall 2023 schedule.</p>

<h3>Streaming</h3>
<p>NBCUniversal's Peacock acquired the U.S. streaming rights to <i>Yellowstone</i> in 2020, with the first two seasons debuting in July of that year. Paramount Global President and CEO Bob Bakish have since called the timing of the deal "unfortunate"; due to the show's improved reception, viewership, and popularity in its later seasons. Critics have noted that <i>Yellowstone</i>'s absence from Paramount's own, similarly named streaming service, Paramount+ (in-spite of the show's spinoffs being produced for the service), in addition to current seasons available on Paramount Network's app and website primarily through TV Everywhere (requiring a paid television subscription), have caused confusion among viewers and the show's fans on social media.</p>

<p>Full episodes and seasons of <i>Yellowstone</i> are available for purchase on all major digital entertainment distribution stores in the U.S., with Amazon's Prime Video streaming new episodes in Canada the day after their U.S. broadcast on Paramount Network. Starting with the fifth season, it will be moved to Paramount+ in Canada, and the UK, and to SkyShowtime in any territories where the service is already available. As with the previous seasons in Canada, new episodes will be released the day after the U.S. airing.</p>

<p>After the fifth-season premiere airing, CMT started rerunning those episodes after being released on Paramount Network on Friday.</p>
