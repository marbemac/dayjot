<div>For the former baseball player, see Ben Shelton (baseball).</div>


<p><b>Benjamin Todd Shelton</b> (born October 9, 2002) is an American professional tennis player. Shelton has a career-high ATP singles ranking of No. 15 achieved on October 23, 2023. He also has a career-high ATP doubles ranking of No. 80 achieved on August 21, 2023.</p>

<p>Shelton won the 2016 USTA junior national championship in doubles. He played college tennis for the Florida Gators. As a true freshman in 2021, he clinched the Gators’ first team national championship with his victory at fifth singles; the following year, he won the men's singles title at the 2022 NCAA Division I Tennis Championships. That same year, he was named the ITA National Player of the Year.</p>

<p>He made his ATP Tour debut in July 2022 at the Atlanta Open where he defeated Ramkumar Ramanathan. The next week, he played in the Cincinnati Masters reaching the third round highlighted by a win over world No. 5 Casper Ruud. In August 2022, Shelton announced he would turn professional.</p>

<p>In January 2023, Shelton reached the quarterfinals of just his second Grand Slam, at the 2023 Australian Open. Later that year, he improved to reach the semifinals of another Major at the 2023 US Open.</p>



<h2>Early and personal life</h2>
<p>Shelton is the son of former professional tennis player and Florida Gators men's tennis coach Bryan Shelton. His mother, Lisa Witsken Shelton, was a highly-ranked junior tennis player, his uncle, Todd Witsken, was a professional tennis player and his sister, Emma, played college tennis at Florida. Shelton was born in Atlanta, Georgia, as his father was the then-coach of Georgia Tech's women's tennis team. He currently lives in Gainesville, Florida and graduated from Buchholz High School.</p>



<h2>Junior career</h2>
<p>As a child, Shelton did not want to play tennis and, instead, played football. Despite both of his parents having connections to the game of tennis, they did not pressure him to play the sport. At age 12, Shelton began playing tennis regularly and was coached by his father, Bryan, who at the time was a college tennis coach.</p>

<p>When Shelton turned 16, he considered playing ITF Junior tournaments abroad, but his father urged him not to do so saying: "Why do you need to travel abroad when you're not the best [player in the U.S.]?" Shelton ultimately credits his father's advice not to play ITF Junior tournaments abroad as helping his tennis development because he was not constantly traveling and instead had a routine.</p>

<p>Shelton peaked at a high of the No. 3 player in the USTA Boys’ 18s division and No. 306 ITF Junior. He was a finalist at the 2020 USTA Boys 18s Singles Winter Nationals and won the 2019 USTA Boys 16s Doubles Clay Court tournament.</p>

<p>In June 2020, on Father's Day, Shelton committed to play collegiate tennis for the Florida Gators, under his father, head coach Bryan Shelton.</p>

<p>A finance major, Shelton helped lead the Gators to their first national championship. Shelton had a singles record of 10–2 and won the championship-clinching match for the Gators.</p>

<p>In 2021-22, Shelton shone during his sophomore year going 37–5 in singles matches and winning the NCAA Singles Championship over August Holmgren. He finished the year as the No. 1 singles player in ITA rankings. He was subsequently named the 2022 ITA National Player of the Year and the 2022 SEC Player of the Year.</p>

<p>In 2022-23, Shelton was slated to return to Florida for his junior year and stated he wanted to complete his finance degree. Shortly after his successful run at the 2022 Cincinnati Masters, Shelton announced he would forego his remaining college eligibility to turn professional and continue his college education online.</p>



<h2>Professional career</h2>
<h3>2022: Three Challenger titles, ATP &amp; Major &amp; Masters &amp; top 100 debuts, first top-5 win</h3>

His fifth Challenger final featured a repeat of his last with a win against Christopher Eubanks in the Knoxville Challenger which lifted him another 20 positions up to No. 108 in the rankings on November 14. After winning his third straight title at the Champaign–Urbana Challenger, he debuted in the top 100 of the rankings ending the year at world No. 97 on November 21, 2022 and became the youngest player in ATP Challenger Tour history to win three titles in three weeks.

His run concluded with a four-set loss to fellow American Tommy Paul. As a result, he moved 45 positions up into the top 50, at world No. 44, for the first time in his career.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the American hard court season for 2023, Shelton faced a tough start, experiencing defeat in the opening round at the 2023 Delray Beach Open, losing in straight sets to Marcos Giron. His struggles continued at the Mexican Open, where he once again fell in the first round, this time to the fourth-seeded Holger Rune, in a match that stretched to three sets. However, Shelton managed to bounce back at Indian Wells, securing a victory over Fabio Fognini in the initial round, only to be bested by fellow American Taylor Fritz in the second round.</p>

<h2>Playing style</h2>
<p>Shelton's best weapon is his serve. He has the ability to hit a big first serve, which averages 126 miles per hour (203km/h). At the US Open in 2023, he hit two service aces at 149.0 miles per hour (239.8km/h). He also can produce a significant amount of kick on both first and second serves. A left-handed player, Shelton is powerful and consistent on both the forehand and backhand side. He is comfortable moving to the net off his powerful groundstrokes to finish points. Shelton has said "I love to get to net, be able to use some of my hand skills, athletic skills and going up to get the ball (to put away overheads) is one of my favorite things to do..." He has said that the serve-and-volley is an important part of his game and an area he wants to further develop.</p>
