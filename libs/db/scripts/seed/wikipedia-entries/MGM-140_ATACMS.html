<h1>MGM-140 ATACMS</h1>

<div>American tactical ballistic missle</div>



<p>The <b>MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System</b> (<b>ATACMS</b>; pronounced /əˈtækəms/) is a tactical ballistic missile manufactured by the US defense company Lockheed Martin. It uses solid propellant, is 13 feet (4.0m) high and 24 inches (610mm) in diameter, and the longest range variants can fly up to 190 miles (300km). The missiles can be fired from the tracked M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and the wheeled M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).</p>

<p>An ATACMS launch container has a lid patterned with six circles like a standard MLRS rocket lid, but contains only one missile; the identical pattern makes it more challenging for enemy intelligence to single it out as a high-value target.</p>



<h2>History</h2>
Demonstration of firing
<p>The concept of a conventional tactical ballistic missile was made possible by the doctrinal shift of the late Cold War, which rejected the indispensability of an early nuclear strike on the Warsaw Pact forces in the event the Cold War went hot. The AirLand Battle and Follow-on Forces Attack doctrines, which emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, necessitated a conventional-armed (hence much more accurate) missile to strike enemy reserves, so the US Army Missile Command sponsored the Simplified Inertial Guidance Demonstrator (SIG-D) program.</p>

<p>Within this program, Ling-Temco-Vought developed a solid-fuel analog of the MGM-52 Lance missile, designated T-22, with a new RLG-based inertial guidance package, which demonstrated unprecedented accuracy. In 1978, DARPA started the Assault Breaker technology demonstration program to attack armor formations with many mobile hard targets at standoff ranges. It utilized the T-22 missile and the Patriot-based Martin Marietta T-16 missile with cluster warheads.</p>

<p>Development of the missile now known as ATACMS started in 1980, when the U.S. Army decided to replace the Lance with a similar nuclear, but also chemical or biological, tipped solid-fuel missile dubbed the Corps Support Weapon System (CSWS). Concerned that two branches were developing too many similar missiles with different warheads, the Department of Defense merged the program with DARPA's Assault Breaker in 1981, and with United States Air Force (USAF)'s Conventional Standoff Weapon (CSW) in 1982–1983.</p>

<p>The new missile system, designated Joint Tactical Missile System (JTACMS), soon encountered USAF resistance to the idea of an air-launched ballistic missile. As a result, in 1984 the USAF ended its participation in the non-cruise missile portion of the program, leading to the missile being re-designated as the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).</p>

<p>In March 1986, Ling-Temco-Vought won the contract for the missile design. The system was assigned the MGM-140 designation. The first test launch came two years later, thanks to earlier experience of the company with previous programs.</p>

<p>The first use of the ATACMS in combat was during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, where 32 of them were fired from the M270 MLRS. During Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, more than 450    missiles were fired. As of early 2015, over 560 ATACMS missiles had been used in combat.</p>

<p>In 2007, the U.S. Army terminated the ATACMS program due to cost, ending the ability to replenish stocks. To sustain the remaining inventory, the ATACMS Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) was launched, which refurbishes or replaces propulsion and navigation systems, replaces cluster munition warheads with the unitary blast fragmentation warhead, and adds a proximity fuze option to obtain area effects. Deliveries were projected to start in 2018. The ATACMS SLEP is a bridging initiative to provide time to complete analysis and development of a successor capability to the aging ATACMS stockpile, which could be ready around 2022.</p>

<p>In January 2015, Lockheed Martin received a contract to develop and test new hardware for Block I ATACMS missiles to eliminate the risk of unexploded ordnance by 2016. The first modernized Tactical Missile System (TACMS) was delivered in September 2016 with updated guidance electronics and added capability to defeat area targets using a unitary warhead, without leaving behind unexploded ordnance. Lockheed was awarded a production contract for launch assemblies as part of the SLEP in August 2017. In 2021, Lockheed Martin was contracted to upgrade existing M39 munitions to the M57 variant with a WDU-18/B warhead from the Harpoon missile by 2024.</p>

<p>A plan announced in October 2016 to add an existing seeker to enable the ATACMS to strike moving targets on land and at sea was terminated in December 2020 to pursue other missile efforts.</p>

<p>The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 authorized the production and procurement of up to 1,700 additional ATACMS systems.</p>

<h3>ATACMS and Ukraine</h3>
<p>ATACMS missiles have been used in the Russia Ukraine conflict. According to the New York Times on 18 October 2023, the U.S. delivered about 20 ATACMS missile systems to Ukraine.</p> 

<p>The use of these missiles placed the entirety of the Russian land corridor in southern Ukraine under direct threat. It further placed within reach the vast majority of the air bases operated by Russia inside Ukraine (north of Crimea), and complicated Russia's use of attack helicopters against a Ukraine. Using ATACMS by Ukraine forced the Russians to to operate from bases within Russia.</p>


<h2>Variants</h2>
<ul><li><b>M39</b> (ATACMS Block I) missile with inertial guidance. It carries 950 M74 anti-personnel and anti‑materiel bomblets, each about the size of a baseball and weighing 1.3lb (0.59kg), which are dispersed across a circular area approximately 677 feet (206m) in diameter, covering 360,000 square feet (33,000m) in total and effective against parked aircraft, ammunition dumps, air defense systems, and gatherings of personnel, but not against armored vehicles. The size of the affected area can be changed by modifying the height at which the payload is released. Range of Block I is 25-165 km (15-100 mi). The M74 has a reported failure rate of 2%, or 19 for each M39 missile fired. Video is available of a U.S. Army test of the M39 at a mock airfield.</li>
<li><b>M39A1</b> (ATACMS Block IA) missile with GPS-aided guidance. It carries 300 M74 bomblets. There were 610 produced between 1997 and 2003. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, 74 were fired at Iraqi targets. The remaining ones are being updated to M57E1 missiles. The M39A1 and later variants can only be used with the M270A1 (or variants thereof) and M142 launchers. Range: 20–300 kilometres (12–186mi).</li>
<li><b>M48</b> (ATACMS Quick Reaction Unitary [QRU]) missile with GPS-aided guidance. It carries the 500-pound (230kg) WDU-18/B penetrating high explosive blast fragmentation warhead of the US Navy's Harpoon anti-ship missile, which was packaged into the newly designed WAU-23/B warhead section. There were 176 produced between 2001 and 2004, when production ceased in favor of the M57. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, 16 were fired at Iraqi targets and a further 42 were fired during Operation Enduring Freedom. The remaining ones are in the US Army and US Marine Corps' arsenal. Range: 70–300km (43–186mi).</li>
<li><b>M57</b> (ATACMS TACMS 2000) missile with GPS-aided guidance. It carries the same WAU-23/B warhead section as the M48. There were 513 produced between 2004 and 2013.  Accuracy is 9m (30ft) CEP (Circular Error Probability). Range: 70–300km (43–186mi).</li>
<li><b>M57E1</b> (ATACMS Modification [MOD]) missile with GPS-aided guidance. <i>M57E1</i> is the designation for upgraded M39 and M39A1 with re-grained motor, updated navigation and guidance software and hardware, and a WAU-23/B warhead section instead of the M74 bomblets. This variant includes a proximity sensor for airburst detonation. Production commenced in 2017 with an initial order for 220.</li></ul>



<h2>Future</h2>
<h3>Precision Strike Missile</h3>
<div>Main article: Precision Strike Missile</div>

<p>In March 2016, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon announced they would offer a missile to meet the U.S. Army's Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) requirement to replace the ATACMS. The missile will use advanced propulsion to fly faster and farther, originally out to 310 miles or 500 kilometres, while also being thinner and sleeker, increasing the loadout to two per pod, doubling the number that can be carried by the M270 MLRS and M142 HIMARS launchers.</p>

<p>Lockheed and Raytheon were to test-fire their submissions for the renamed Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) program in 2019, with the selected weapon planned to achieve Initial Operational Capability in 2023. The initial PrSM will only be able to hit stationary targets on land, but later versions will track moving targets on land and sea. With the United States withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in August 2019, it was announced that the range of the PrSM would be increased beyond the '499km' limitation previously placed upon it by the treaty.</p>

<p>In June 2020, the Army had begun testing a new multi-mode seeker — an upgrade for the Precision Strike Missile. The missile will enter service in 2023. The upgraded seeker is expected to be part of a major program improvement planned for 2025. In July 2021, the U.S. announced that Australia had become a partner in the PrSM Program with the Australian Army, signing a memorandum of understanding for Increment 2 of the program with the US Army's Defense Exports and Cooperation agency, and contributed US$54 million. The United Kingdom announced its intentions to field the PrSM starting in 2024 as part of an upgrade to the British Army's M270 MLRS.</p>
