<div>Men's cricket tournament</div>
<div>This article is about the men's cricket tournament. For the women's cricket tournament, see Women's Asia Cup. For other uses, see Asia Cup (disambiguation).</div>





<p>The <b>Asia Cup</b>, officially known as the <b>ACC Men’s Asia Cup</b> is a men's international cricket tournament contested between Asian countries in either One Day International format (50 overs) and Twenty20 International cricket format (20 overs). It was established in 1983 when the Asian Cricket Council was founded as a measure to promote goodwill between Asian countries. It was originally scheduled to be held every two years. The Asia Cup is the only continental championship in cricket and the winning team becomes the champion of Asia. It alternates every 2-years between ODI and T20 formats. India are the current champions after winning the recent 2023 edition.</p>

<p>The first Asia Cup was held in 1984 in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates where the council's offices were based (until 1995). India boycotted the 1986 tournament due to strained cricketing relations with Sri Lanka. Pakistan boycotted the 1990–91 tournament due to strained political relations with India and the 1993 tournament was cancelled for the same reason. The ACC announced that the tournament would be held biennially from 2009 onwards.The ICC has ruled that all games played in the Asia Cup have official ODI status.</p>

<p>After downsizing the Asian Cricket Council in 2015, it was announced by the ICC that Asia Cup events from 2016 would be played on a rotation basis between One Day International and Twenty20 International format, on the basis of the format of upcoming world events. As a result, the 2016 event was the first event played in the T20I format and functioned as a preparatory tournament ahead of the 2016 ICC World Twenty20.</p>

<p>India, with eight titles (seven ODI and one T20I), is the most successful team in the tournament. Sri Lanka is the second most successful team, with six, while Pakistan have won two titles. Sri Lanka has played the most Asia Cups (15) followed by India, Pakistan and Bangladesh (14 each).</p>
