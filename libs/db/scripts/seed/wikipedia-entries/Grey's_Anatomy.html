<p><i><b>Grey's Anatomy</b></i> is an American medical drama television series focusing on the personal and professional lives of surgical interns, residents, and attendings at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. The series premiered on March 27, 2005, on ABC as a mid-season replacement. The show's title is an allusion to <i>Gray's Anatomy</i>, a classic human anatomy textbook. Writer Shonda Rhimes developed the pilot and served as showrunner, head writer, and executive producer until stepping down in 2015. The series is filmed primarily in Los Angeles, California, and Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>

<p>The original cast consisted of nine star-billed actors: Ellen Pompeo, Sandra Oh, Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, T. R. Knight, Chandra Wilson, James Pickens Jr., Isaiah Washington, and Patrick Dempsey. For most of its run, the series revolves around Dr. Meredith Grey (Pompeo), chronicling her progression from surgical intern to fully-qualified doctor to the hospital's chief of general surgery. The cast has undergone major changes throughout the series' run, with only three original members remaining by the 19th season – Pompeo, Wilson, and Pickens. Pompeo stepped back from the series in its 19th season, at which point the show shifted to more of an ensemble format. As of February13,2023, the show has been picked up for a 20th season. <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> has two spin-off series: <i>Private Practice</i> (2007–2013) and <i>Station 19</i> (2018–present).</p>

<p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> is the longest-running scripted primetime show currently airing on ABC, and the longest scripted primetime series carried by ABC. Its success catapulted many series regulars including Pompeo, Dempsey, and Oh to worldwide recognition; they were among the top five highest-earning television actors in 2013. Once among the overall top-ten shows in the United States, the show's ratings have fallen, although as of 2017 it was still one of the highest-rated shows among the 18–49 demographic. The show also does well on streaming television; as of February2023, <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> was ranked the 10th most popular on-demand program.</p>

<p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> has been well received by critics throughout much of its run and has been included in various critics' year-end top 10 lists. Since its inception, the show has been described by the media outlets as a television "phenomenon" or a "juggernaut", owing to its longevity and dominant ratings. It is considered to have had a significant effect on popular culture and has received numerous awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama and a total of 38 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including two for Outstanding Drama Series. The cast members have also received accolades for their individual performances.</p>



<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>The series follows the life of Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), the daughter of the famous general surgeon Ellis Grey (Kate Burton), starting from her acceptance into the surgical residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital (later named Seattle Grace Mercy West and finally, Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital). During her time as an intern, Grey works alongside fellow physicians Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), who each struggle to balance their personal lives with hectic schedules and stressful residency requirements. During their internship, they are overseen by Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), a senior resident, who works with attending physicians Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), head of neurosurgery and Meredith's love interest, and Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), head of cardiothoracic surgery, who becomes Yang's fiancé. Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), Chief of Surgery and attending general surgeon, is the former lover of Ellis Grey. During the first 6 seasons, Burke, O'Malley, and Stevens all depart the series.</p>

<p>The series also shows drama and emotions focused on Meredith's life. In addition to Webber, Burke, and Shepherd, the surgical wing is primarily supervised by Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), Shepherd's ex-wife and the head of OB/GYN, neonatal and fetal surgery who leaves for Los Angeles at the end of season 3; Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), head of plastic surgery and also certified in ENT surgery; Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), a resident who later becomes head of orthopedic surgery and leaves Seattle for New York at the end of the 12th season; Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), as head of cardiothoracic surgery, who leaves Seattle Grace in season 5 after a disagreement with Torres, with whom she shared a brief relationship; Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), as head of trauma surgery who later marries and divorces Yang; Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), as head of pediatric surgery, and later head of maternal / fetal surgery who marries Torres; Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), as head of cardiothoracic surgery who departs at the end of season 8 but returns in season 14; and Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone), Derek's sister, who is hired to replace him as head of neurosurgery.</p>

<p>Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Meredith's paternal half-sister, joins the residency program in season 4 until her death with her love-interest Mark Sloan in the plane crash at the end of season 8, after which Seattle Grace is renamed Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in their memory. Former Mercy-West residents April Kepner (Sarah Drew) and Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) join Seattle Grace following an administrative merger in season 6. Other additions include Leah Murphy (Tessa Ferrer), who departs at the end of season 10 but returns during season 13; Shane Ross (Gaius Charles), who leaves with Yang for Zurich, Switzerland, in the season 10 finale; Stephanie Edwards (Jerrika Hinton), who resigns at the end of season 13; Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington), who marries Karev; Andrew DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti), the former love interest of Meredith's maternal half sister Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) who also served as head of cardiothoracic surgery; and Ben Warren (Jason George), an anesthesiologist-turned resident-turned firefighter who marries Bailey. Season 11 sees the death of Derek Shepherd, and in season 12, attending cardiovascular surgeon Nathan Riggs (Martin Henderson) joins the show, and later briefly becomes Meredith's love interest. In the early episodes of season 14, Thomas Koracick (Greg Germann), an attending neurosurgeon, begins making appearances and Riggs leaves the series to start a life with Owen's long-lost sister Megan (Abigail Spencer); by the season finale, Robbins, Kepner and Warren also depart the show. Midway through the 16th season, Cormac Hayes (Richard Flood) becomes the new chief of pediatric surgery and Karev departs to reunite with Stevens. During the 17th season, DeLuca is stabbed while chasing a child abductor and despite the efforts of Hunt and Altman, he dies. Avery and Koracick also depart in season 17, with Avery moving to Boston to take over his family's Foundation and Koracick leaving to assist him. In Season 18, Hayes moves back to his home country, Hunt and Altman flee the country, Marsh returns to Minnesota, Webber and Fox go on sabbatical, and Bailey resigns as chief of surgery, leaving Grey as chief of surgery of Grey-Sloan Memorial. In Season 19, new interns Simone Griffith (Alexis Floyd), Benson "Blue" Kwan (Harry Shum Jr.), Jules MIllin (Adelaide Kane), Mika Yasuda (Midori Francis) and Lucas Adams (Niko Terho), Derek and Amelia's nephew, join the program; Meredith moves to Boston and Pierce departs to move to Chicago.</p>

<p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> follows the lives of surgical interns, residents, and attendings at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (formerly Seattle Grace Hospital, Season 1–6, Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Season 6–9, and then Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital, Season 9–present), as the interns gradually develop into seasoned doctors through the mentoring of their residents, attendings, and chiefs of surgery. Each installment typically begins with a voice-over narrative from Meredith Grey or a season regular, foreshadowing the theme of the episode. Each season tends to represent the physicians' academic year, with each completed year qualifying the residents at a level higher in the surgical field. The season typically ends with a dramatic event such as a death or character departure. Most installments revolve around the doctors' everyday lives as surgeons, but the show also emphasizes their personal, as well as their professional, lives. The series often sets aside medical ethics concerns in order to foreground character development and relationships. While the physicians treat the illnesses of their patients, often through complex surgeries, they also display a competitive spirit and seek praise.</p>

<p>After arriving at the hospital each morning, residents may argue over who gets the challenge of a certain patient who has arrived that day. A hospital superior assigns cases, often generating tension between the residents and their superiors. Within each episode, there are shifts from the doctors interacting with their patients, to scenes with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or romantic, which may produce conflicts between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voiceover, typically contrasting or following up on the initial one.</p>

<h3>Main cast</h3>
<p>The five characters who are first introduced in the series premiere as surgical interns, are Meredith Grey, Cristina Yang, Izzie Stevens, Alex Karev, and George O'Malley. They are initially mentored by Dr. Miranda Bailey, a senior resident who becomes the hospital's Chief Resident, and later an attending general surgeon, in season 6. The surgical program is initially headed by Richard Webber, the Chief of Surgery, who has a pre-existing personal relationship with Meredith, having had an affair with her mother when Meredith was a child. In Webber's employ are attending neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd, dubbed 'McDreamy' by the residents, and attending cardiothoracic surgeon Preston Burke. Shepherd is introduced as Meredith's love-interest, while Burke begins a relationship with Yang.</p>

<p>Introduced in the show's second season are obstetrician-gynecologist and neonatal surgeon, Addison Montgomery, plastic and ENT surgeon Mark Sloan (nicknamed 'McSteamy' by the interns), from New York, and orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres. Montgomery is Shepherd's estranged wife who arrives in Seattle seeking reconciliation with him, Sloan is Shepherd's former best-friend, who aided the breakdown of his marriage by having an affair with Montgomery, while Torres is introduced as a love-interest, and eventual wife for O'Malley. The penultimate episode of season 3 introduces Lexie Grey, Meredith's half-sister who unexpectedly decides to pursue her internship at Seattle Grace Hospital after her mother's sudden death, and begins an on-again, off-again relationship with Sloan. Burke and Yang, having been engaged, endeavor to plan their wedding, while Montgomery departs the show in the season 3 finale, relocating to California, seeking a new life, thus becoming the lead character of the spin-off <i>Private Practice</i>. The season 3 finale also shows Burke's exit from the show, after leaving Yang at the altar on their wedding day.</p>

<p>Grey, Yang, Stevens, and Karev are all promoted to residents in the season 4 premiere, while O'Malley is forced to repeat his internship year, following his failing of the intern exam. Subsequently, Torres and O'Malley divorce one another, due to him having an affair with Stevens, initially concealing it from Torres. Early in the fourth season, cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn becomes Torres's love-interest. During the fifth season, Hahn departs from the series after a disagreement with Torres, and O'Malley retakes his intern exam, passes and joins his fellow physicians as a resident. Two new characters are introduced, former United States Army trauma surgeon Dr. Owen Hunt, and pediatric surgeon Dr. Arizona Robbins. Hunt becomes a love-interest for Yang, while Robbins begins a relationship with Torres. When Stevens is diagnosed with stage IV metastatic melanoma, she and Karev get married at the conclusion of the fifth season. In addition, Meredith and Shepherd marry, with their vows written on a blue post-it note.</p>

<p>O'Malley dies in the premiere of the sixth season, due to injuries sustained from saving a woman from being hit by a bus, and Stevens later departs Seattle following a communication breakdown with her then-husband Karev following the Seattle Grace merger with Mercy West Hospital. New characters are introduced as Seattle Grace Hospital merges with Mercy West Hospital. Residents April Kepner and Jackson Avery transfer to Seattle Grace Hospital from Mercy West Hospital, and Avery has a brief relationship with Lexie, until she reunites with Sloan. Subsequently, Teddy Altman is introduced as the new Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Ben Warren is also introduced in the sixth season, who becomes a romantic interest for Bailey throughout the series, eventually marrying her. In the season 6 finale, a deceased patient's grieving husband embarks on a shooting spree at the hospital, injuring Karev, Shepherd, and Hunt. In the shooting's emotional reverberations, Yang and Hunt abruptly marry, not wanting to risk separation. Torres and Robbins eventually wed, officiated by Bailey. In season 8, Webber steps down as Chief of Surgery and allocates his job to Hunt. As the final year of residency for Meredith, Yang, Karev, Kepner and Avery is coming to a close, the doctors are all planning to relocate to different hospitals to pursue their specialty careers. However, all plans are put on hold when several doctors from Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital are engaged in a plane crash, which kills Lexie and endangers Meredith, Shepherd, Yang, Sloan and Robbins in the season 8 finale. The season finale also sees Altman being courteously fired by Hunt as she struggles to decide whether or not to take the job as Chief at the United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM).</p>

<p>In the season 9 premiere, Sloan dies due to sustained injuries from the plane crash following a brief relapse of temporary health ("the surge") and the remaining characters work through their post traumatic stress and Arizona Robbins's loss of limb by way of suing Seattle Grace Mercy West, as the hospital was responsible for putting the surgeons on the plane. Meanwhile, Jo Wilson, Stephanie Edwards, Leah Murphy and Shane Ross are introduced as a new group of interns. The season continues with the struggle of the lawsuit and the animosity that it creates within the hospital, Yang and Hunt eventually divorce in order to help the lawsuit. The doctors who were on the plane win the lawsuit, but the payout bankrupts the hospital. They all club together and buy Seattle Grace Mercy West, with the help of the Harper Avery Foundation, and they become the Board of Directors, once being called the "Grey-Sloan 7". One of the changes they implement is renaming the hospital to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in memory of Lexie Grey and Mark Sloan. Robbins cheats on Torres with a visiting facial reconstruction surgeon and Webber gets electrocuted in the season 9 finale, although survives the incident. <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> saw the departure of one of its major players, Cristina Yang, played by Sandra Oh, as well as the departure of interns Murphy and Ross, in the season 10 finale. Amelia Shepherd, the sister of Derek, joined the main cast in Season 11, transitioning over from being a main character of the spin-off series, <i>Private Practice</i> which had recently ended. The 11th season also saw the introduction of the new Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Maggie Pierce, Richard's secret daughter with Ellis Grey. Towards the end of the 11th season, Derek Shepherd witnesses a car accident and pulls over to help the injured, but his car is hit by a truck with him inside as he attempts to leave the scene. He later dies at another hospital following the doctors' mishandling of his injuries. The twelfth season saw Andrew DeLuca join the main cast as a new intern at the hospital, as well as Nathan Riggs as a new cardiothoracic surgeon with a pre-existing off-screen history with Hunt. The season 12 finale saw the departure of one of the show's longest-running characters, Callie Torres, played by Sara Ramirez. Edwards departed at the end of the thirteenth season, deciding to quit her job as a surgeon after surviving a major fire at the hospital. Riggs departed and Altman returned to Seattle toward the beginning of the 14th season. The fourteenth season also saw the introduction of Tom Koracick who worked as a new neurosurgeon alongside Amelia Shepherd, Levi Schmitt who is a new intern at the hospital, as well as Andrew's sister, Carina DeLuca, an obstetrician who enters into a relationship with Robbins. During the fourteenth season, Warren transitions out to become a main character of the series' second spin-off, <i>Station 19</i>, after his character decides to quit working at the hospital to become a firefighter. Carina DeLuca eventually joins him as a main character of that spin-off series. Long-time characters, Robbins and Kepner depart the series in the season finale to pursue other career opportunities. The fifteenth season saw the introduction of Atticus "Link" Lincoln, as a new orthopedic surgeon, while the sixteenth season saw the introduction of Cormac Hayes, a new pediatric surgeon, and Winston Ndugu, a new cardiothoracic surgeon. Season 16 was the last to feature Alex Karev, who moved to Kansas to reunite with Stevens, leaving Grey as the last remaining intern from the original cast. Season 17 saw Nick Marsh, a transplant surgeon, join the ensemble of main characters as a new romantic interest for Meredith Grey. The seventeenth season also saw the departure of Andrew DeLuca, after he was stabbed and ultimately died after pursuing a sex trafficker, and was also the last season to feature both Jackson Avery, who moved to Boston in order to run a family foundation and Koracick, who also moved to Boston to assist Avery, as main characters. Hayes departed the series in its 18th season after deciding to return to Ireland with his kids.</p>

<p>Season 19 saw the introduction of five new interns with Simone Griffith, Mika Yasuda, Benson Kwan, Jules Millin and Lucas Adams, the latter of which is revealed to be a nephew of Amelia and Derek Shepherd. Meredith Grey, one of the last remaining original characters of the series, as well as Pierce, both depart Seattle during the course of the nineteenth season.</p>

This ultimately ends in his death season 2 finale, marking his initial departure from the show, and placing Stevens on disciplinary probation. Initially conceived as a veterinarian hired for Shepherd's dog, Doc, Dr. Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell) soon becomes a love-interest for Meredith, while Shepherd is with Montgomery. Dandridge is included in a multi-episode story arc in seasons 2 and 3, consisting of 9 episodes, ending when Meredith reunites with Shepherd.</p>

<img alt=" A photo of Chyler Leigh" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Chyler_Leigh_headshot.jpg/170px-Chyler_Leigh_headshot.jpg" height="227" width="170" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Chyler_Leigh_headshot.jpg/255px-Chyler_Leigh_headshot.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Chyler_Leigh_headshot.jpg/340px-Chyler_Leigh_headshot.jpg 2x" />Chyler Leigh's character was introduced in the third season and was promoted to series regular in season 4.

<p>In season 3, George's father, Harold O'Malley (George Dzundza), is diagnosed with cancer and dies, with his wife Louise (Debra Monk) and George's brothers Jerry (Greg Pitts) and Ronny (Tim Griffin) by his side. Louise goes on to appear occasionally, and was last seen in season 8. A ferryboat accident brings along Rebecca Pope (Elizabeth Reaser), who is initially introduced as a pregnant amnesiac Jane Doe patient. Pope eventually embarks on a relationship with Karev, until she is diagnosed with a personality disorder in season 4, and makes her final departure. Amidst the crisis of the ferryboat crash, Meredith falls into the water at the disaster site. Although rescued, she goes into cardiac arrest, waking up in what appears to be limbo. Within the limbo, Meredith is entertained by deceased acquaintances Duquette and Dylan Young (Kyle Chandler), who was killed during a bomb crisis in the second season, until eventually being resuscitated. Seeking a cure to her depression, Meredith undergoes therapy sessions with the hospital psychiatrist, Dr. Katharine Wyatt (Amy Madigan), who in addition, serves as a psychiatrist to Hunt.</p>

<p>The season 4 premiere introduces several new interns, to be trained under Meredith, Yang, Stevens, Karev, and eventually O'Malley. Among them are Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul) who continues to make appearances, and Dr. Sadie Harris (Melissa George) who formed a friendship with Meredith while the two were in college. Harris is fired in the fifth season, due to not actually having a medical degree, and departs the show immediately after. Meredith and Shepherd's relationship reaches a crisis, and the two separate, leaving Shepherd to entertain a relationship with Rose (Lauren Stamile), a nurse. Rose appears frequently until season 5, when Derek and Meredith decide to rekindle their flame. Throughout the fifth season, Stevens experiences full-out hallucinations of Duquette, signaling that she is ill, and once she is lucid, he departs, marking his final appearance. Following the announcement of her relationship with Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Callie's father Carlos Torres (Hector Elizondo) initially contests his daughter's concurrence in homosexuality, but eventually accepts it, and he reappears several times throughout the series.</p>

Robbins receives a grant to aid children in Malawi, which leads to a falling-out between her and Torres. While in Malawi, Robbins is replaced by Dr. Robert Stark (Peter MacNicol), a pediatric surgeon with an interest in Dr. April Kepner, who appears occasionally until season 8. Following the breakdown of Dr. Torres's relationship with Dr. Robbins, Dr. Torres becomes pregnant with Dr. Sloan's baby. Torres's relationship with Robbins is subsequently mended, and the couple endeavors to raise their new daughter, Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres, with the help of Dr. Sloan.

Trying to save Dr. Webber, she accidentally steps into a puddle and electrocutes herself while hitting her head as she falls. Also introduced in season 10 was Dr. Karev's estranged father Jimmy Evans (James Remar) who tries to form a relationship with his son but fails repeatedly, and dies in a botched surgery. The conclusion of season 10 has Cristina leaving Grey Sloan for Dr. Burke's job as head of Klausman Institute for Medical Research in Zurich, while Dr. Ross makes a last-minute decision to follow her in order to study under her. Dr. Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) unknowingly drops a bombshell that she is the child of Dr. Webber and the late Dr. Grey, and was given up at birth for adoption. Dr. Meredith Grey has to accommodate another half-sister in her life. Also, Dr. Yang privately gives her shares in the hospital to Dr. Karev, also giving him her seat on the board.

<h2>Production and development</h2>

<h3>Conception</h3>
<p>Shonda Rhimes wanted to make a show that she would enjoy watching, and thought it would be interesting to create a show about "smart women competing against one another".</p><p>

When asked how she decided to develop a medical drama, Rhimes responded: </p><blockquote><p>I was obsessed with the surgery channels... My sisters and I would call each other up and talk about operations we'd seen on the Discovery Channel. There's something fascinating about the medical world—you see things you'd never imagine, like the fact that doctors talk about their boyfriends or their day while they're cutting somebody open. So when ABC asked me to write another pilot, the [operating room] seemed like the natural setting.</p></blockquote><p>

The series was pitched to ABC Entertainment, who gave the green light. The show was picked up as a mid-season replacement for <i>Boston Legal</i> in the 2005 television season. Francie Calfo, executive vice president of development at ABC Entertainment, commented that ABC was looking for a medical show that was unlike the others airing at the time. She pointed out: </p><blockquote><p>Medical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, [Rhimes] found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it.</p></blockquote>

<div>

<blockquote>
<p><i>ER</i> is high-speed medicine. The camera flies around, adrenaline is rushing. My show is more personal. The idea for the series began when a doctor told me it was incredibly hard to shave her legs in the hospital shower. At first, that seemed like a silly detail. But then I thought about the fact that it was the only time and place this woman might have to shave her legs. That's how hard the work is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Rhimes on the creation of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i></p>
</div>

<p>While creating characters, as well as writing the first script, the series' writers had no character descriptions in mind, and hoped to cast the best actor available for each part. Rhimes has said that if the network had not allowed her to create characters this way, she would have been hesitant about moving forward with the series. Female roles, in particular, were developed as multi-faceted characters.</p><p>

Rhimes offered her insight: </p><blockquote><p>I wanted to create a world in which you felt as if you were watching very real women. Most of the women I saw on TV didn't seem like people I actually knew. They felt like ideas of what women are. They never got to be nasty or competitive or hungry or angry. They were often just the loving wife or the nice friend. But who gets to be the bitch? Who gets to be the three-dimensional woman?</p></blockquote>

<p>The show's title, <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>, was devised as a play on words: a reference to both Henry Gray's classic English medical textbook, <i>Gray's Anatomy</i> (first published in 1858 and still in print), and the title character Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). Before the series debuted on March 27, 2005, a few early releases were shown to close friends and family of the producers and actors. The show was scheduled to run in the <i>Boston Legal</i> time slot for 4 weeks.</p>

<p>The show's high ratings and viewership resulted in ABC keeping it in that slot for the remainder of the season. ABC Entertainment President, Steve McPherson, commented on the scheduling change: "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let [<i>Grey's Anatomy</i>] build on its tremendous momentum through May." Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would be changed from <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> to <i>Complications</i>, although this did not take place.</p>

<h3>Production team</h3>

<p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> is produced by ShondaLand, in association with The Mark Gordon Company, and ABC Studios (formerly Touchstone Television). Rhimes, Betsy Beers, Krista Vernoff, Mark Gordon, Rob Corn, and Mark Wilding have all served as executive producers throughout the course of the series. In subsequent seasons, Steve Mulholland, Kent Hodder, Nancy Bordson, James D. Parriott, and Peter Horton have also been executive producers, with Allan Heinberg joining the show in 2006 in this role. As of season eight, the executive producers were Rhimes, Beers, Gordon, Vernoff, Corn, Wilding, and Heinberg.</p>

<p>Rhimes is the series head writer, or its most prolific writer. In its early years, she often promoted the show by answering fan questions on her Twitter account. Other members of the writing staff are Vernoff, Wilding, Peter Nowalk, Stacy McKee, William Harper, Zoanne Clack, Tony Phelan, Joan Rater, and Debora Cahn. From the second through seventh seasons, the writers maintained a blog entitled <i>Grey Matter</i>, where the writer of an episode discussed background of the writing.</p> 

<p>Directors vary by episode, with Rob Corn directing most frequently, followed by Tom Verica. Horton, Edward Ornelas, and Jessica Yu have also directed a substantial number of episodes. Cast members Chandra Wilson, Debbie Allen, and Kevin McKidd have each directed multiple episodes.</p>

<p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> has been edited by Susan Vaill since the show's inception, and David Greenspan was named an editor in 2006. Casting directors Linda Lowy and John Brace have been a part of the production team since 2005. The production design is led by Donald Lee Harris, assisted by art director Brian Harms, and costume design is led by Mimi Melgaard. Working alongside Melgaard, Thomas Houchins supervises costumes, Ellen Vieira is the makeup artist, and Jerilynn Stevens serves as a hairstylist. The Director of Photography is Herbert Davis. The music coordinator is Danny Lux.
Karen Lisa Pike, M.D. is the on-set medical consultant, alongside Linda Klein, an RN. In an interview, Ellen Pompeo (Meredith Grey) stated "We always ask Linda, you know, what is this procedure, what is this surgery, when is this performed, what happens"- various members of the cast spoke of the importance of having real surgeons around especially in learning how to properly hold instruments, how to accurately use medical language and develop their characters in an authentic way; most of the cast members observed real surgery in real life as preparation for their roles. The production staff is part of a <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> softball team that competes against other television shows, such as <i>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</i>.</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<div>

<blockquote>
<p>She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Rhimes on Oh's audition</p>
</div>

<p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> used a color-blind casting technique, resulting in a racially diverse ensemble. Each role was cast without the character's race being pre-determined, keeping Rhimes's vision of diversity. The production staff began casting with the program's title character, Dr. Meredith Grey, which Rhimes said was a challenging role to cast. "I kept saying we need a girl like that girl from <i>Moonlight Mile</i> (2002)," said Rhimes, "and after a while, they were like, 'We think we can get that girl from <i>Moonlight Mile</i>." The next to be cast, Sandra Oh (Dr. Cristina Yang), was initially invited to audition for the character of Bailey, but pressed to read for the role of Cristina instead. Many actors read for the role of Dr. Derek Shepherd. Rob Lowe was offered the role, but turned it down as he had already agreed to star in another medical drama <i>Dr. Vegas</i>. When Patrick Dempsey read for the part, "he was just perfect," according to Rhimes.</p>

<p>The only character developed with a racial description in mind was Dr. Miranda Bailey, who is portrayed by Chandra Wilson. Her character was first described as a tiny blonde with curly hair, but when Wilson began speaking, Rhimes reported: "[Wilson] is exactly who Miranda is." James Pickens Jr. was selected to appear as Dr. Richard Webber in the series' pilot and first season. Katherine Heigl wanted to portray Dr. Izzie Stevens as a brunette but was requested to retain her natural blonde for the part. Isaiah Washington, who portrayed Dr. Preston Burke, initially read for the role of Shepherd but was cast as Burke, because the original actor to play Burke had to withdraw. T. R. Knight signed on for the pilot as Dr. George O'Malley, expecting that the role might be short-lived, because he liked that the character was multi-faceted. Rounding out the season 1 cast was Justin Chambers as Dr. Alex Karev, a character who was not originally included in the show's pilot, but added through digital editing and additional scenes.</p>

<img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Eric_Dane_March_2015.jpg/170px-Eric_Dane_March_2015.jpg" height="254" width="170" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Eric_Dane_March_2015.jpg/255px-Eric_Dane_March_2015.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Eric_Dane_March_2015.jpg/340px-Eric_Dane_March_2015.jpg 2x" />Eric Dane originally auditioned for the pilot episode of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>, but was not cast at that time.

<p>Season 2 marked the introduction of attending doctors Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). They were initially cast as recurring characters, but both were given star billing at the opening of season 3. Ramirez was cast after ABC executives offered them a role in the network show of their choice; Dane had previously auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in the pilot episode. Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) also joined the show in season 2, after making a guest appearance in the season 1 finale</p>

<p>In October 2006, Washington allegedly insulted Knight with a homophobic slur, during an on-set altercation with Dempsey, and ABC terminated Washington's contract at the end of season 3. Washington returned for a guest appearance in season 10. At the conclusion of season 3, Walsh departed the show to pursue the <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> spin-off, <i>Private Practice</i>, but continues to make guest appearances.</p>

<p>Chyler Leigh joined the cast as a main character in season 4 as Dr. Lexie Grey, Meredith's half-sister. Leigh had appeared as a guest-star in the final 2 episodes of season 3. On the selection of Leigh for the role of Lexie, Rhimes said: "Chyler stood out ... It felt like she could be Meredith's sister, but she had a depth that was very interesting."</p>

<p>Dr. Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), who first appeared on <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> in season 2, returned as a series regular in season 4. Shortly after the announcement that Smith would be a regular member of the cast, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>'s Michael Ausiello, reported that her character, Hahn, would depart from <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> on November 6, 2008. <i>E! Online</i>'s Kristin Dos Santos asserted that Smith's dismissal from the show had been forced by the ABC network, as part of an attempt to "de-gay" <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>. Rhimes countered these claims, saying that "we did not find that the magic and chemistry with Brooke's character would sustain in the long run".</p>

<p>Season 5 introduced actor Kevin McKidd (Dr. Owen Hunt), who was signed as a series regular after originally being cast for a specific story-arc. In addition, Jessica Capshaw (Dr. Arizona Robbins) was originally introduced for a 3-episode arc, but her contract was extended until the end of the season; she became a series regular in the sixth season.</p>

<p>Knight departed the show at the conclusion of season 5, citing an unhappiness with the development and lack of screen-time for his character. Directly following Knight's departure, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> reported that Heigl had not returned to the set as scheduled after her maternity leave. It was later confirmed that Heigl would not return to the show at all.</p>

<p>Kim Raver, who was cast as recurring character Dr. Teddy Altman in season 6, was given star billing later in the season. Sarah Drew (Dr. April Kepner) and Jesse Williams (Dr. Jackson Avery), who both made their series debuts as recurring characters in the sixth season, and received star-billing in the seventh.</p>

<p>The 6 original actors' contracts expired after season 8, but in May 2012, Pompeo, Oh, Chambers, Wilson, Pickens Jr. and Dempsey renewed their contracts with the show for another 2 years. At the conclusion of season 8, Leigh's character Lexie Grey departed from the show at Leigh's request, and with Rhimes's agreement. Raver's character Teddy Altman was also written out of the show during the season 8 finale. Rhimes said that Raver had been offered a contract renewal, but declined.</p>

<p>In July 2012, Dane (Sloan) confirmed that he was departing the show to pursue other projects; he made his final appearances in the first 2 episodes of season 9. With the start of season 10, Camilla Luddington, Gaius Charles, Jerrika Hinton and Tessa Ferrer were introduced to the show as series regulars. They were first introduced to the show in season 9 as the new interns. On August 13, 2013, Oh (Cristina) announced that the show's tenth season would be her final one. In March 2014, it was announced that Isaiah Washington, who portrayed Preston Burke in the first 3 seasons of the show, would make a guest appearance to coincide with the departure of series regular Sandra Oh, his former on-screen love-interest. Neither Charles's nor Ferrer's contracts were renewed for season 11.</p>

<p>On May 2, 2014, it was announced that, in addition to Pompeo and Dempsey, all the original remaining cast members—apart from Oh—signed 2-year deals, extending their contracts through seasons 11 and 12. Despite joining the series in season 2, Sara Ramirez was on the same negotiation schedule as the season 1 cast and also signed a new 2-year deal. On April 23, 2015, Dempsey departed the show during the show's 11th season, despite the fact that he still had a year left in his contract. On the night of the season 12 finale, May 19, 2016, Sara Ramirez announced that they would be leaving the show following the decision to not renew their contract.</p>

<p>On January 17, 2018, it was announced by ABC that Ellen Pompeo's contract had been renewed through season 16. Not only did the contract renewal insure that Pompeo will return as Meredith Grey, but it made her a producer of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> and a co-executive producer of <i>Station 19</i>. The deal made Pompeo the highest-paid actress currently on a dramatic TV series, with her making $575,000 per episode and over $20 million yearly. On March 8, 2018, it was announced that series regulars Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew would not be returning for season 15 after executive producers decided to let them go. In May 2018, it was confirmed that Kim Raver, who made returning guest appearances in season 14, would once again become a series regular, beginning with season 15. In January 2020, Justin Chambers announced that he had departed the series and that his final episode had aired on November 14, 2019. In March 2021, Giacomo Gianniotti departed the series after wanting to pursue new things such as directing. In May 2021, Jesse Williams and Greg Germann both left the main cast, although Germann is expected to remain on the show in a guest capacity. In September 2021, it was announced that Kate Walsh would be returning as Addison Montgomery for multiple episodes in season 18. In July 2022, it was announced that Alexis Floyd, Niko Terho, Adelaide Kane, Midori Francis and Harry Shum Jr. joined the cast as series regular for the nineteenth season. In August 2022, it was announced that Ellen Pompeo will appear in only eight episodes of the upcoming nineteenth season, but that she will continue to narrate the episodes and will remain an executive producer.</p>

<h3>Filming locations and techniques</h3>

<img alt="The space needle in Seattle, Washington." src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Space_Needle_from_Elliott_Bay.jpg/170px-Space_Needle_from_Elliott_Bay.jpg" height="227" width="170" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Space_Needle_from_Elliott_Bay.jpg/255px-Space_Needle_from_Elliott_Bay.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Space_Needle_from_Elliott_Bay.jpg/340px-Space_Needle_from_Elliott_Bay.jpg 2x" />The Space Needle, in Seattle, is the background to many exterior shots.
<p>Rhimes considered setting the medical drama in her hometown, Chicago, but eventually decided to go with Seattle, to distinguish <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> from the Chicago-based series <i>ER</i>.</p>

<p>Fisher Plaza, which is the headquarters building of the former Fisher Communications (since merged into Sinclair Broadcasting Group) and SBG's ABC-affiliated KOMO radio and television stations in Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital. In particular, air ambulances land on the KOMO-TV news copter's helipad. This suggests the hospital is close to the Space Needle (which is directly across the street from Fisher Plaza), the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks.</p>

<p>However, the hospital used for most other exterior and a few interior shots is not in Seattle; these scenes are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California, and occasional shots from an interior walkway above the lobby show dry California mountains in the distance. The exterior of Meredith Grey's house, also known as the Intern House, is real. In the show, the address of Grey's home is 613 Harper Lane, but this is not an actual address. The physical house is located at 303 W. Comstock St., on Queen Anne, Seattle, Washington. Most scenes are taped at The Prospect Studios in Los Feliz, just east of Hollywood, where the <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> set occupies 6 sound stages. Some outside scenes are filmed at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle. Several props used are working medical equipment, including the MRI machine.</p>

<p>When asked about operating room scenes, Sarah Drew said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We work with bovine organs, which is cow's organs, The smell is repulsive and makes us all gag. And we use an actual soldering tool to solder the organs. It smells like burning flesh. There's also a lot of silicone and blood matter, red jello mixed with blood and chicken fat. It's pretty gross.</p></blockquote>

<p>Costumes are used to differentiate between attending surgeons, who wear navy blue scrubs, and residents, who wear light blue scrubs. The series is filmed with a single-camera setup, as are many dramas. <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> is often filmed using the "walk-and-talk" filming technique, popularized on television by series such as <i>St. Elsewhere</i>, <i>ER</i>, and <i>The West Wing</i>.</p>

<p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i>'s first season commenced airing as a mid-season replacement to <i>Boston Legal</i> on March 27, 2005, and concluded on May 22, 2005. The 9-episode season aired on Sundays in the 10:00pm EST time slot, following <i>Desperate Housewives</i>. The show was renewed by ABC for a second season, that aired in the same time slot as season 1. Premiering on September 25, 2005, and concluding on May 15, 2006, the season consisted of 27 episodes. As the original first season order was for 13 episodes, 5 episodes were held for season 2, as ABC decided to close the first season of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> on the same night as <i>Desperate Housewives</i>' finale. During season 2, <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> produced 2 specials recapping the events of recent episodes, narrated by Bailey, entitled "Straight to the Heart" and "Under Pressure". The show was renewed for a third season, which was relocated to the coveted Thursday 9:00 pm EST time slot. The show has remained on Thursdays since then.

<h2>Reception</h2>

<h3>Critical response</h3>
<div>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> offers a different and perhaps more valuable idea of what it means to be strong: the capacity to suffer terribly, break down completely, and then get up again, confident that you're bigger than the sum of the tragedies you've suffered—because everyone else is, too. The layers of history have grown pretty dense and rich, and the friendships that form around them as the characters suffer and survive is the glue of the series, and what—despite a few inevitable hit-or-miss patches—elevates it to something special.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Laura Hudson of <i>Wired</i></p>
</div>

<p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> has been well received among critics. As of August 2023, the show holds an average score of 84% on <i>Rotten Tomatoes</i>. Emily VanDerWerff of <i>The A.V. Club</i> gave an insight on the series' overwhelming success and the lows, writing that the quality arc is "all over the place". She noted the steady build-up in the first season; the series skyrocketing into a phenomenon in the second season; the gradual dip in season three; and "some seriously bumpy moments" in the fourth and the fifth season, which was interrupted by the writers' strike. VanDerWerff felt that the "climb begins again in season six". Samantha Highfill of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> in a review wrote, "I believe the show's best season to date is season 2. Let me make it clear that I'm not saying seasons 3 through 9 were bad. In my opinion, there have only been a few lulls in the show's history, and most of them didn't last a full season." adding, "I still enjoy the show, and I'll honestly never stop watching. By any standards, <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> has been successful television, ranking highly in the ratings for nine seasons and entering the cultural lexicon via phrases as cloying yet catchy as 'McDreamy', the show has had its periods of being intensely irritating, and it has had its periods when it seems as if Shonda Rhimes has taken leave of her faculties, but it's also got an amazingly high batting average, particularly with every solid season that passes along in this second act of its run." The site lauded the show saying, "On average, it's been very good TV, filled with interesting, driven characters who run the gamut of professions within the show's hospital setting. It's been, by turns, a good soap, a good romantic comedy, a good medical drama, and a good interpersonal show about an unexpected workplace family."</p>

<p>The first season received positive reviews which steadily built up, with Gary Levin of <i>USA Today</i> calling <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> one of the top shows on television. The New York <i>Daily News</i> named <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> a "winner", whereas <i>Newsday</i> expressed a positive opinion by stating "You simply can't stop watching." <i>The Washington Post</i>'s Tom Shales was critical of season one, finding it reminiscent of <i>ER</i> and commenting that: "The show is much more a matter of commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different." Shortly after its initial airing, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>'s Maureen Ryan called <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> the new <i>Friends</i> (a concluded National Broadcasting Company (NBC) sitcom following the lives of a group of young adults, that for all of its 10-year run was in the top-5 for viewer ratings). The second season received high critical acclaim: top critics like Emily VanDerWerff of <i>The A.V. Club</i> called the show a "phenomenon", adding the show was, "one of the best TV shows around", while Samantha Highfill of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> later during the tenth season called the second "the show's best season to date". However, Kevin Carr of <i>7M Pictures</i> opined that <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> is a mere combination of <i>Scrubs</i>, <i>ER</i>, <i>Sex and the City</i> and <i>The Love Boat</i>. It further garnered positive reviews: Christopher Monfette of <i>IGN</i> added "The second season of this medical drama expertly wove its signature elements of complex relationships, whimsical banter and challenging life-lessons; all to a montage-fetish, indie-rock soundtrack." Todd Gilchrist, also from <i>IGN</i>, called the season "terrific" adding, "Indeed, one of the best currently on television. While it remains to be seen what the creators do with it, now that it's become an outright event program, the season demonstrates that Rhimes and co. know what to do with the opportunities presented them. whether you're male or female, this is the kind of entertainment that small-screen devotees and folks fed up with television need to see."</p>

<img alt=" A photo of Ellen Pompeo" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Ellen_Pompeo_LF.JPG/170px-Ellen_Pompeo_LF.JPG" height="224" width="170" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Ellen_Pompeo_LF.JPG/255px-Ellen_Pompeo_LF.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Ellen_Pompeo_LF.JPG/340px-Ellen_Pompeo_LF.JPG 2x" />Critics have highlighted Ellen Pompeo's due for an Emmy Award on multiple occasions.

<p>The title character of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>, Meredith, has received both overwhelmingly positive and weary feedback by critics along the course of the show, with the development of the character garnering praise from majority critics. Earlier reactions for Meredith were mixed; in a 2006 review, Alessandra Stanley of <i>The New York Times</i> dubbed to her as "the heroine of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>". A reviewer for <i>BuddyTV</i> praised the distinct uniqueness in the character calling Meredith an "unconventional heroine" adding that the character was, "Neither black nor white but always ... wait for it ... many shades of grey. The reviewer and to add that even in her lighter moments, she has still been "dark and twisty." The sentiment was shared by Glenn Diaz who remarked, "You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy." When Pompeo did not receive a nomination 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, for her work as Meredith. Mary McNamara of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> suggested that Pompeo, "has worked very hard ... to make Meredith Grey an interesting character", and should have received a nomination. <i>IGN</i>'s Monfette, less impressed by the character, criticized her storyline as "some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do." Robert Rorke of the <i>New York Post</i> was critical of Meredith's relationship with Derek Shepherd, writing: "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, she's been a little dopey, what with the endless 'McDreamy' soliloquies." The development of the character has received praise from critics. Reviewing the first part of the eighth season, TV Fanatic wrote: "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the <i>heart and soul</i> of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman. Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season." Rick Porter reviewing the episode "How to Save a Life" from the 11th season for <i>Zap2it</i> wrote, "Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, "How to Save a Life" would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode, the likes of which the show has done several times before. He added "'How to Save a Life" may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Ellen Pompeo, considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it. But it's among the best work she's ever done on the show." Janalen Samson of <i>BuddyTV</i> lauded the Meredith's development throughout the series saying, "When one considers how this character has grown over eleven seasons, it really is amazing. Kudos to Ellen Pompeo for her fine work. She's actually done the impossible, because I actually care what happens to Meredith Grey." Reviewing the season 12 premiere, "Sledgehammer", critics including Alex Hawkins of the <i>Western Gazette</i> again highlighted Pompeo's being due for an Emmy Award.</p>

<p>The majority of the supporting cast of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> have been well received as well, with the <i>New York Post</i>'s Rorke deeming Stevens to be "the heart-and-soul" of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>, whereas Eyder Peralta of the <i>Houston Chronicle</i> was critical of her character development, stating: "[She's] the reason I don't watch <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> anymore." Kelli Catana of <i>The Huffington Post</i> named Yang "the best damn character" and deemed "the Meredith/Yang relationship the most true friendship on network television." <i>Television Without Pity</i> writer Lauren Shotwell claimed Yang is "the only one of these five [residents] that regularly acts like an actual doctor". Analyzing Alex Karev, Rachel Simon called him "underrated", and she pointed out that his personal growth never seems to get acknowledged, as "Alex has evolved, slowly and realistically, into a genuinely good person whose faults don't miraculously disappear, but take a backseat to much better qualities." Robert Bianco of <i>USA Today</i> said Dempsey has a "seemingly effortless way of humanizing Derek's 'dreamy' appeal with ego and vanity". His friendship with Mark Sloan has been well received. Victor Balta said "they've demonstrated an easy chemistry that makes for some of the great comic relief around Seattle Grace Hospital." Addison Montgomery was deemed "sassy and bright and interesting." <i>TV Guide</i> said of Walsh's stint on <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> that she "adds spice to an already hot show." Callie Torres, after having previously received mixed reviews, was praised for her bisexual storyline. Critics added that the character was anchored by stellar performances by Sara Ramirez. Lexie Grey, having initially been criticized, became a critics' favorite in the series. Alex Keen of <i>The Trades</i> wrote that Lexie's "presence and confidence have increased quite a bit ... and actress, Chyler Leigh, does a fantastic job of making this progression feel seamless. Since the series has defused the tension between Little Grey and Big Grey (aka Meredith), Lexie has clear sailing through the season and steals the show as one of the best current characters on the series."</p>

<p>With the departure of several cast members throughout the seasons, many new characters have been added to the drama's ensemble. McKidd and Capshaw were referred to as "fresh additions" to the series, by Monfette of <i>IGN</i>. Matt Roush of <i>TV Guide</i> commented: "Hunt is the most encouraging thing to happen to <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> in quite a while." Matt Mitovich of <i>TV Guide</i> noted that Robbins "quickly established herself as a fan favorite", describing her as "a breath of fresh air in the often-angsty halls of Seattle Grace. On April Kepner and Jackson Avery, Courtney Morrison of <i>TVFanatic</i> wrote, "April has grown since her character was introduced ... she's honest. A girl with principles is a girl you want to do well." He described her and Avery as "a couple for whom viewers can root". Speaking of the new cast members, in addition to the remaining original ones, Robert Bianco from <i>USA Today</i> called them the show's "best ensemble in years".</p>

<p>Regarding season three, Bill Carter of <i>The New York Times</i> called <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> "television's hottest show", adding: "[No show] is expected to challenge <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> for prime-time pre-eminence." Contrasting with Carter's view, Monfette of <i>IGN</i> said that it speedily found itself "mired in the annoying and absurd", adding: "This third season may very well represent a case of over-writing a concept that has, perhaps tragically, run bone-dry on narrative fuel." At the conclusion of season three, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>'s Gregory Kirschling said "the show lacked a defining happy, warm-gooseflesh moment", adding that the season "didn't leave you dying for the [next] season premiere". Speaking of the fourth season, Laura Burrows of <i>IGN</i> said the series became "a little more than mediocre, but less than fantastic", adding: "This season proved that even strong chemistry and good acting cannot save a show that suffers from the inevitable recycled plot."</p>

<p>In contrast to the moderately negative feedback the third and fourth seasons received, Alan Sepinwall of <i>The Star-Ledger</i> said of the fifth season: "Overall, it feels more like the good old days than <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> has in a long time." Misha Davenport from the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> said season five "hits on all the things the show does so well", adding: "There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears." Brian Lowry of <i>Variety</i>, less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines. Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of <i>USA Today</i> wrote: "<i>Grey's</i> has always loved grand gestures. You like them or you don't; the only real question is whether the show pulls them off or it doesn't. This year, it did."</p>

<p>The series has a score of 66 out of 100 on <i>Metacritic</i>, based on five reviews for season seven. In response to the season, Bianco from <i>USA Today</i> commented: "Happily, it now seems to have landed on solid ground." Also of the seventh season, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>'s Jennifer Armstrong said: "It's in the shooting's emotional reverberations that the show is regenerating after the past few hit-and-miss seasons," whereas Verne Gay of <i>Newsday</i> commented: "Unfortunately, they've settled on far-too-easy and facile answers for the most part." <i>HitFix</i> gave a positive review saying that, "season seven overall has been one of the show's strongest ever." and added, "There was a time when <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> was this show where I suffered through a lot of stuff that made me cringe to get to those genius melodrama moments it could do so well. Over the last couple of years, it's evolved into a show that's much more consistent in tone, where it may not move me as often as it did in the early years but also very rarely makes me question my reasons for watching." Speaking of season eight, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>'s Mandi Bierly called it a "so-so season", and Lesley Goldberg of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> called it "emotional". Also acknowledging the fan base, Verne Gay of <i>Newsday</i> wrote "<i>Grey's</i> has had a good season and has an intensely loyal fan base to prove it." regarding the eighth season.</p>

<p>The ninth season received more positive reviews, Rob Salem of <i>Toronto Star</i> called it "a solid return to form." Praising the friendship between Meredith and Cristina of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> wrote, "There's still one good reason to keep watching: Where else can you find such deep friendships between female co-workers". The tenth season was also marked with praise, Annie Barrett for <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> wrote "There's true sorrow here along with the passion, which keeps their dynamic so intriguing to me." Caroline Siede from <i>The A.V. Club</i> wrote in her review for the tenth season "At its best, <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> is about everyday bravery, sacrifice, and courage. At its worst, it's a melodramatic, moralizing soap opera. Both sides are on display as the show heads confidently into its 10th season." Many sources, including Rachel Simon of <i>Bustle</i> and Nicole Pomarico of <i>Wetpaint</i>, claimed that Sandra Oh's performance during her final season on <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> is worthy of an Emmy nomination.</p>

<p>Bryce Olin of <i>Netflix</i> ranked <i>Grey's</i> 9th among the <i>50 Best TV Shows on Netflix</i> stating, "It's a tough call, but based on <i>Grey's</i> casting choices and revolutionary portrayals of female doctors in the series, I'm willing to argue that <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> is the best medical drama of all time. Obviously, Shonda Rhimes didn't reinvent the wheel with the series, but there's no denying its popularity." adding, "I understand its significance in the pop culture sphere." He also stated that the show could go higher in the ranks with the upcoming season stating, "Apparently, <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> fans are passionate about their show, although it seems like they've been closeted for the last few years. I'd love to move <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> even higher on the ranking, but I'll have wait until the eleventh season comes to Netflix."</p>

<p>The show was criticized for its handling of a controversy: The <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> scandal revolved around actor Isaiah Washington using a homophobic slur on set. Mainstream media coverage scapegoated this scandal as "black masculinity for perpetrating homophobia, thus containing both sexual and racial difference in the name of tolerance."</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> makes an impact on how people's perception of the world is created.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> has been considered impactful on culture by <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>'s executive editor, Lori Majewski, with her writing: "<i>Grey's Anatomy</i> isn't just a show, it's a phenomenon. When [the] final shows air, every place in New York City is empty. You could get a table at the best restaurants." <i>The Daily Beast</i>'s Jace Lacob also considered the show an impact, comparing its success to that of <i>Friends</i>, and calling it a "cultural phenomenon". Steve Sternberg, a media analyst with Magna Global USA explained that the show appeals to a broad audience, writing: "Roughly 80 percent of households during prime time only have one TV set on. People are looking for shows they can watch with other household members." In its initial seasons, <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> introduced a "Mc-labeling" surge, which started when various characters dubbed Dempsey's character "McDreamy". Canadian newspaper the <i>National Post</i> considers this trend a "phenomenon". Analyzing the show's impact on culture, Dessylyn Arnold of <i>Yahoo! Voices</i> noted that the "Mc-labeling" trend has been parodied on other shows including <i>ER</i> and <i>Degrassi: The Next Generation</i>. Mark Lawson of <i>The Guardian</i> has credited <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> with popularizing the "songtage", or musical montage segments. Parodying this, <i>MADtv</i> spoofed the show in 2006, making fun of the series' emotional scenes including those accompanied by a musical montage.</p>

<p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> has also been credited to helping redefine "good" television; <i>The A.V. Club</i> writes, "Since <i>The Sopranos</i> burst onto the scene, we've too often classified a show as "good" based on how closely it adhered to the dark, violent, male-centric template set out by that particular show. It's time for that to end. At its best, <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> has been among the very best shows on TV, and at its worst, it's been at least fascinating to watch. To write it off is to unnecessarily narrow the definition of what good TV can be, to limit what the medium is capable of. TV is at its best when it emotionally connects, and even when it seems to be otherwise merrily hurtling off a cliff, <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> is nothing but emotional connection, which is more than other, more consistently better shows can say." The series placed at No. 66 on <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>'s "New TV Classics" list in 2007, and was declared the third-highest rated show for the first ten years of the <i>IMDb</i> (2002–2012). The show's premise has inspired the creation of <i>A Corazón Abierto</i>, a Colombian adaptation of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>, which in turn spawned a Mexican version of the same name.</p>

<p>An additional study conducted by Brian Quick of the University of Illinois indicated that the show's portrayal of doctors being "smart, good looking, capable, and interesting", leads viewers to associating real-world doctors to be that way. Surgical resident Karen Zink, M.D., deemed the show's portrayal of interns inaccurate, adding: "None of [the characters] have bags under their eyes. They all leave the hospital dressed cute, with their hair done and makeup on. That is so far away from the reality of interns. You are just dragging your butt, trying to stay alive. You don't have time to do your hair. You don't have time to put on makeup. Every surgical intern has bags under their eyes."</p>

<p>In 2011, a woman residing in Sheboygan, Wisconsin became unresponsive due to an asthma attack. Unable to wait for an ambulance, her daughter and a friend performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on her, which they learned from <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>. In 2017, an Israeli woman saved her husband by performing cardiac massage she learned from <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>, The woman performed cardiac massage for 20 minutes before medical personal arrived and transferred the husband to Shaare Zedek Medical Center. The mid-season premiere of the 14th season was entitled "1-800-799-7233", the National Domestic Violence Hotline; upon release on January 18, 2018, the move was received favorably and viewers variously changed their Twitter usernames to the same and used the platform to bring awareness to both the hotline and the issue of domestic abuse.</p>

<h3>U.S. television ratings</h3>
<p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> has received high viewership and ratings since its debut. The first 4 seasons of the program each ranked in the top 10 among all viewers, reaching its peak Nielsen ratings in the second season, attracting an average of 19.44 million viewers per episode, and ranking at No. 5 overall. Following the show's time-slot being relocated, overall rankings steadily declined, dropping below the top 10 in its fifth season. <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> made its greatest fall from its sixth to seventh season, slipping from #16 to No. 31. The series is on a steady decline in terms of overall viewership and rankings, yet <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> still holds value in charts when numbers are pulled from the digital video recorder (DVR). It was the most recorded show between 2007 and 2011, based on cumulative totals, and has been for several years in a row.</p>

<p>The most-watched episode of the series is "It's the End of the World", with 37.88 million viewers, aided by a lead-in from Super Bowl XL. <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> was the most expensive program on television in the 2007–08 season measured by advertising revenue, with earnings of US$400,000 per 30 seconds. The show was named the fourth (behind <i>Desperate Housewives</i>, <i>Two and a Half Men</i>, and <i>American Idol</i>), and the fifth-highest (behind <i>Glee</i>, <i>Two and a Half Men</i>, <i>The X Factor</i> and <i>American Idol</i>) revenue-earning show, with the earnings of US$2.67 million and US$2.75 million per half hour in 2011 and 2012 respectively. While <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> is no longer ranked in the top numbers for overall ratings, the show's ranking in the key 18–49 demographic has remained high. As of season 8, the series is the highest-rated drama on television in the target demographic. In 2016, a <i>New York Times</i> study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> was "most popular in a swath of the middle of the country, particularly in areas with a lower percentage of college graduates".</p>

<p>Below is a table of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>'s seasonal rankings in the U.S. television market, based on average total viewers per episode. Each U.S. network television season starts in September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.</p>

<h2>Spin-offs and adaptations</h2>

<p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> has spawned several spin-offs and adaptations.</p>

<h3><i>Private Practice</i></h3>
<div>Main article: Private Practice (TV series)</div>

<img alt="Kate Walsh smiling at the camera in a blue dress" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Kate_Walsh_2011_crop.jpg/170px-Kate_Walsh_2011_crop.jpg" height="207" width="170" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Kate_Walsh_2011_crop.jpg/255px-Kate_Walsh_2011_crop.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Kate_Walsh_2011_crop.jpg/340px-Kate_Walsh_2011_crop.jpg 2x" />The cast of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> was displeased with the network's decision to center the spin-off on Kate Walsh's character.

<p>On February 21, 2007, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> reported that ABC was pursuing a spin-off medical drama television series for <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> featuring Walsh's character, Addison Montgomery. Subsequent reports confirmed the decision, stating that an expanded two-hour broadcast of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> would serve as a backdoor pilot for the proposed spin-off. The cast of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> was reportedly unhappy about the decision, as all hoped the spin-off would have been given to them. Pompeo commented that she felt, as the star, she should have been consulted, and Heigl disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Stevens. The backdoor pilot that aired on May 3, 2007, sees Montgomery take a leave of absence from Seattle Grace Hospital, to visit her best-friend from Los Angeles, Naomi Bennett (Merrin Dungey, later Audra McDonald), a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist. While in Los Angeles, she meets Bennett's colleagues at the Oceanside Wellness Center. The two-hour broadcast entitled "The Other Side of This Life" served as the twenty-second and twenty-third episodes of the third season, and was directed by Michael Grossman, according to <i>Variety</i>. The cast included Amy Brenneman, Paul Adelstein, Tim Daly, Taye Diggs, Chris Lowell, and Merrin Dungey.</p>

<p>KaDee Strickland's character, Charlotte King, who would be introduced in the spin-off's first-season premiere, did not appear in the backdoor pilot. Her addition to the main cast was announced on July 11, 2007, prior to the commencement of the first season. She did not have to audition for the role, but was cast after a meeting with Rhimes. Also not present in the backdoor pilot was McDonald, due to her character, Naomi Bennett, being portrayed by a different actress, Merrin Dungey. However, on June 29, 2007, ABC announced that Dungey would be replaced, with no reason given for the change. The drama was titled <i>Private Practice</i>, and its premiere episode followed the second part of the season debut of <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>, and provided a lead-in to fellow freshman series <i>Dirty Sexy Money</i>. <i>Pushing Daisies</i>, a third new series for the evening, rounded out the lineup as a lead-in to <i>Private Practice</i>. The series ended its run on January 22, 2013, after 6 seasons.</p>

<h3><i>Station 19</i></h3>
<div>Main article: Station 19</div>
<p>On May 16, 2017, Channing Dungey announced at the ABC Upfronts that the network ordered another <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> spin-off, this one focusing on firefighters in Seattle. The series premiered mid-season in 2018. Stacy McKee, long-term <i>Grey's</i> writer and executive producer, serves as the spin-off's showrunner. The new show was introduced Season 14, Episode 13, when a house fire brings the firefighters to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. In July 2017, it was announced that Jaina Lee Ortiz was the first actress cast in the spin-off series. In September 2017, it was announced that Jason George, who has played Dr. Ben Warren since season 6, would be leaving <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> to move to the spin-off. He continued to be a series regular on <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> until the spin-off began production. In October 2017, it was announced that 5 new series regulars for the spin-off had been cast being Grey Damon, Jay Hayden, Okieriete Onaodowan, Danielle Savre and Barrett Doss. It was also announced that the spin-off had a 10-episode order for the first season. Later in October 2017, it was announced that Miguel Sandoval was cast as the Captain of the firehouse.</p>

<h3><i>Grey's Anatomy: B-Team</i></h3>
<p>On January 9, 2018, it was announced by Sarah Drew on her Instagram page that a 6-episode spin-off series following the new interns of Grey Sloan Memorial would be released for streaming on the ABC app and <i>abc.com</i> on Thursday, January 11, 2018. <i>Grey's Anatomy: B-Team</i> stars Sophia Taylor Ali (Dahlia Qadri), Jake Borelli (Levi Schmitt), Alex Blue Davis (Casey Parker), Jaicy Elliot (Taryn Helm), Rushi Kota (Vik Roy) and Jeanine Mason (Samantha "Sam" Bello) with special guest appearances made by Justin Chambers (Alex Karev), Kelly McCreary (Maggie Pierce), Kevin McKidd (Owen Hunt) and James Pickens Jr. (Richard Webber).
