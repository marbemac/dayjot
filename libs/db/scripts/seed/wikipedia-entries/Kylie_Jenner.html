The novel was criticized upon release as a ghostwritten work, which prompted its ghostwriter Maya Sloan to reveal that while the Jenner sisters wrote a two-page outline for what they wanted the novel to be like, Sloan was truly responsible for the writing of the book. However, the Jenners' creative director, Elizabeth Killmond-Roman, clarified that the two had numerous Skype and FaceTime calls with Sloan to discuss the content of the novel.

<p>The Jenner sisters were booed while introducing brother-in-law Kanye West's performance at the Billboard Music Awards in May 2015. In May 2015, an episode of <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</i> premiered in which Jenner admitted to getting a lip augmentation. Her enhanced lips from lip fillers created speculation and gained her publicity. Prior to the episode's debut, Jenner stated that she merely used lip liner and over lined her lips. As a result, the practice of suctioning one's lips into a small glass in order to induce greater blood flow to swell the lips was called the "Kylie Jenner Challenge" (though there was no indication that Jenner herself employed this method). Jenner responded to this by stating, "I'm not here to try &amp; encourage people/young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look." In August 2015, Jenner announced that she would be launching her first lipstick line as a part of her self-titled lip kit under the name Kylie Lip Kit. In November 2015, the Jenner sisters appeared in singer Justine Skye's "I'm Yours" music video.</p>

<p>In February 2016, Jenner's cosmetic company was renamed to Kylie Cosmetics and the number of kits produced rose from an initial 15,000 to 500,000. Jenner released a three-minute-long promotional video for a series of lip glosses in March 2016, directed by Colin Tilley and starring fellow models Karin Jinsui, Mara Teigen, and Jasmine Sanders. The song in the video was revealed to be "Three Strikes" by Terror Jr, a band created on the same day as the release of the video; however, the lead singer, who was later revealed to be singer Lisa Vatale, was heavily speculated to be Jenner herself. However, Jenner subsequently denied any involvement with the band. In May 2016, she made her musical debut rapping on producer Burberry Perry's song "Beautiful Day", with Lil Yachty, Jordyn Woods, and Justine Skye. The next month, Jenner starred in another PartyNextDoor's music video for his song "Come and See Me". In April 2017, she made a surprise appearance at the Rio Americano High School prom in Sacramento alongside junior Albert Ochoa after hearing that his date had turned him down.</p>

<p>In June 2017, Jenner was placed at number 59 on the <i>Forbes</i> Celebrity 100, which calculates the 100 highest-paid celebrities of the previous 12 months, after earning approximately US$41,000,000, making her the youngest person on the list at 19 years old.</p>

It was reported that Global Brands Group (GBG) previously listed the Kendall + Kylie brand on its website. As a result, the Jenners stated that their company is owned by a separate entity known as 3072541 Canada Inc. even though they say that their brand "has worked with CAA-GBG in the past, in a sales and business development capacity only" and that they "do not currently have any relationship at all with GBG".

<h2>Controversies</h2>

<h3>Kendall + Kylie "Rock vs. Rap" collection</h3>
<p>On June 28, 2017, the Jenner sisters announced that they would be releasing a line of vintage T-shirts for their Kendall + Kylie line of clothing called Rock vs. Rap, featuring the likenesses of various rock and rap artists including The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Metallica, Pink Floyd, The Doors, Ozzy Osbourne, and Led Zeppelin, with pictures of the Jenner sisters superimposed over them. The announcement of this line of products was met with swift backlash from relatives and representatives of the figures depicted on the shirts themselves, including Sharon Osbourne, Jim Jampol, and Voletta Wallace, mother of Biggie Smalls. They were also criticized on social media and were called "insensitive." Wallace, The Doors' manager and the estate of Jim Morrison issued a cease-and-desist letter to the Jenner sisters, writing that they did not authorize the sisters' use of the likenesses of these musical icons. The Jenners apologized for the shirts, and pulled them from retail.</p>

<h3><i>Forbes</i> cover</h3>
<p>Jenner appeared on the cover of the August 2018 issue of <i>Forbes</i>. The magazine claimed she had a net worth of $900 million and that she was on the verge of becoming the youngest "self-made" billionaire. This would beat Mark Zuckerberg, who became a billionaire at age 23. However, the publication's use of the term "self-made" sparked widespread criticism and jokes online. Critics argued that Jenner was already born into fame and fortune. Some discussions took a more serious tone, with journalists writing pieces on wealth distribution, inequality and inheritance, as well as upward mobility in society. However, celebrities such as Jenner's half-sister Kim Kardashian and socialite Paris Hilton have come out and defended Jenner, legitimizing assertions that she is indeed self-made, while Hilton who was born into the Hilton family also described herself as self-made.</p>

<p>In May 2020, <i>Forbes</i> released a statement accusing Jenner of forging tax documents so she would appear as a billionaire. The publication also accused her of fabricating revenue figures for Kylie Cosmetics. The same day, Jenner responded in a series of tweets, writing: "What am I even waking up to? I thought this was a reputable site... All I see are a number of inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol. I've never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there EVER. Period". Jenner's attorney also demanded that <i>Forbes</i> retract the statements, calling the magazine's accusations "unequivocally false". <i>Forbes</i> reacted, stating that they spent months uncovering the facts and concluded that their "extensively-reported investigation was triggered by newly-filed documents that revealed glaring discrepancies between information privately supplied to journalists and information publicly supplied to shareholders". However, Jenner became the youngest person on <i>Forbes</i>'s list of 100 Richest Self-Made Women in October 2020. She is the only person on the list in her 20s, and is worth $700 million.</p>

<h3>Cultural appropriation</h3>
<p>Jenner has been accused of appropriating African-American culture and style. In 2016, Jenner was criticized for posting a photograph of herself wearing cornrows on Instagram. In June 2017, urban streetwear brand PluggedNYC accused Jenner of stealing their designs for her collection of camouflage swimwear.</p>

<h3>Underpaying factory workers</h3>

<p>Remake, a non-profit, labeled Global Brands Group as the manufacturer for the Kendall + Kylie clothing line. The organization claimed that money was being withheld from workers in the factories despite having finishing their work. The organization also reported them firing workers in Los Angeles, affecting over fifty-thousand workers. She received criticism for this on multiple platforms, with fans asking her to pay her workers. In response to this, the clothing line said that Kendall + Kylie was not owned by Global Brands Group.</p>

<h3>Lawsuits and civil disputes</h3>
<h4>Vlada Haggarty</h4>
<p>In January 2017, make-up artist Vlada Haggarty claimed that Jenner had stolen the creative style and aesthetic of her own work, such as the dripping gloss lip and golden finger tips, for her own products, and that Jenner had a history of taking Haggerty's original dripping lip art and passing it off as her own. Jenner later credited Vlada on social media and her work on the creation of the logo and an undisclosed settlement was paid to avoid any future legal issues.</p>

<h4>"Kylie" trademark</h4>
<p>In February 2017, Australian singer Kylie Minogue won a legal battle against Jenner for name trademark "Kylie". Jenner had filed a U.S. trademark application for use of the name "Kylie" for "advertising services" and "endorsement services" in 2015.</p>

<h4>Neon lip logo</h4>
<p>Sara Pope, a British painter whose work has been featured in art galleries in several cities across the globe, filed a lawsuit against Jenner and NBC Universal for the use of a neon lip logo. Pope stated that Jenner posted to her social media accounts an image that was remarkably similar to Pope's most famous piece, "Temptation Neon" and used it to promote Jenner's TV series <i>Life of Kylie</i>. TMZ reported that the production art created for the series, including the lip design, was created by a third party designer.</p>

<h4>Seed Beauty</h4>
<p>Seed Beauty filed a lawsuit against Coty and Kylie Cosmetics, alleging that Coty has purchased $600 million in Kylie Cosmetics stock from Jenner as a subterfuge to learn trade secrets.</p>
