<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>Brynn is a seamstress still living in her childhood home who mourns the loss of her mother, Sarah, and her best friend, Maude. She copes with these losses by constructing a model town in her living room. She leads a solitary existence, and is shunned by the townspeople. One night, she awakens to discover an intruder in her home and discovers it is a humanoid alien. The alien uses telekinesis to subdue her, but Brynn accidentally kills it with the broken fragment of a model bell tower.</p>

<p>Brynn discovers that all electrical devices and her car have been rendered useless since the aliens' intrusion, and cycles into town, finding evidence of alien attacks on her neighbors. The town appears unaffected as she makes her way to the local police station. There, Brynn unexpectedly encounters Maude's parents, who happen to be the chief of police and his wife. Maude's embittered mother spits in Brynn's face. Brynn decides to flee the town by bus, but several passengers, controlled by alien parasites, attempt to restrain her. She escapes and discovers that many of the townspeople now appear to be under the aliens' control.</p>

<p>Brynn returns home and fortifies her house. That evening, a tractor beam from a flying saucer carries the alien's corpse out of her house, and Brynn is forced to fend off two more alien intruders, impaling one with a broken mop handle, and immolating the larger entity when its legs become entangled in her car and she ignites the gas tank. After she runs back into her house, another alien restrains her and places a parasite in her mouth. She falls into an intense hallucination in which her life is back to normal and Maude is still alive. With great effort, she breaks free of the hallucination and pulls the parasite from her mouth, finding herself in a field. A flying saucer arrives and transforms the parasite into a doppelgänger of Brynn, which pursues the real Brynn into the woods.</p>

<p>The doppelgänger catches Brynn and stabs her, but Brynn kills it with a box-cutter and escapes to a deserted road. There she encounters an immense alien before being sucked into a flying saucer. She is psychically probed by a group of aliens within the craft, revealing the event that turned the town against her: during an argument she had with Maude when both were much younger, Maude knocked Brynn to the ground and Brynn struck Maude with a stone, killing her. The aliens converse with one another and appear to agree on a course of action. They return Brynn to Earth unharmed and free of their influence.</p>

<p>Brynn is later shown living a happy life in her repaired home. The other residents of the town are under control of the aliens and, in stark contrast with Brynn’s life before the invasion, greet her warmly.</p>
