<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>The series was picked up by BET+ on February 24, 2021. The series premiered on September 9, 2021.</p>

<p>On February 1, 2022, the series was renewed for a second season.</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<p>The main cast was revealed on March 25, 2021.</p>

<p>On March 17, 2022, J. Marques Johnson joined the cast in a recurring role for the second season.</p>



<h2>Novel Adaptation</h2>
<p>The television series in loosely based on Christian Keye's fictional story and characters from his 2015 urban novel <i>Ladies Night</i>. Whereas the main character in the television series is set around <i>Marilyn 'Madam' DeVille</i> and her crimes while the novel sets premise of the main character <i>Amp Anthony</i> and his crimes and romance. Albeit his character in the series have followed similar experiences relating to the book being an ex-con. Madam's name in the series is also changed from 'Madam' <i>Mary</i> <i>Fox</i> (novel) to <i>Marilyn</i> <i>DeVille</i> and is the owner of Club Eden as in the book, but however does not share relation to Anthony as the television series intertwines their stories together, as Amp is now Madam's estranged nephew. One other character adapted from the novel, DJ Dime is also named Allison, who in similarity with the book befriends and have a romantic relationship with Amp Anthony. The premise of the television series revolves more about the lives of the many exotic dancers at Club Eden but creates and leaves the central focus on Madam who becomes the villain and savior of the show. </p>



<h2>Crossovers</h2>
<p><i>All the Queen's Men</i> sets its own storyline and have not featured any crossover characters from other shows as of yet, however the main character Marilyn 'Madam' guest starred on Tyler Perry's <i>Sistas</i> in season 5 and was revealed to be the cousin of Fatima, an independent tough-minded character from the series that eventually gained her own spin-off series <i>Zatima,</i> Madam does a favor and helps Fatima's co-worker Andi, who needs help to get her friend Sabrina out of legal troubles. Also while also not seen in episodes prior <i>(Sistas),</i> she also sent thugs to help out Fatima in her own troubles after being harassed by her co-worker Hayden. Fatima reveals this both to Andi after to the two met each other and Hayden while threatening him once again as a reminder to what really happened to him violently weeks ago.</p>

<p>Another character from the series El Fuego, appeared as a recurring character on <i>Sistas</i> rekindling his connection with Danni, a past college mate and friend to the ladies of the series. He tries to makes attempts at romance with Danni and flaunts his new career as a male exotic dancer at Club Eden, after years of losing weight and started his health and fitness journey after his long battle of being overweight <i>(which is addressed often as a brief running gag in 'Queen's Men')</i>, but the romance eventually fails after finally giving it a try with Danni, however he continued to do favors helping out the ladies on the series when needed from his multiple side jobs.</p>

<p>The actor Skyh Alvester Black, who portrays Amp on <i>All The Queens Men</i> did appear on <i>Sistas</i> as a recurring character named Jacobi who briefly dated Sabrina on their series. This in turn may have created confusion upon viewers as both series shares the same parallel universe in story plots.</p>
