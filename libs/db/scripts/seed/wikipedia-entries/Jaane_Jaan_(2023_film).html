<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>In Kalimpong, Maya D'Souza is a divorced, single mother who works at a cafeteria. Naren Vyas is a reclusive, but brilliant mathematics teacher, who lives next door to Maya and Tara (Maya's daughter). Naren is solemn and introverted, and his morning exchanges with Maya from whose cafeteria he buys lunch, is the brightest part of his day.</p>

<p>When Ajit, Maya's abusive ex-husband &amp; a policeman, shows up one night to extort money from Maya, threatening both her and Tara, the situation quickly escalates into violence and Ajit is killed by mother and daughter on the apartment floor.</p>

<p>Overhearing the commotion from his room and deducing that Ajit has been killed, Naren offers his help to the mother and daughter. He not only disposes the body, but also plots the cover-up step-by-step.</p>

<p>Inspector Karan Anand, a former classmate of Naren, is assigned to track the missing Ajit, which leads him to Kalimpong.  There he runs into his old classmate Naren, along with burned remains with Ajit's credentials. Karan's suspicions immediately fall to Maya.  Autopsy shows that the murder occurred on the 10th.  Maya and Tara have a detailed alibi.  Karan tries his best to poke holes in it.</p>

<p>Unable to poke any holes in Maya's holiday, he is ready to go back.  Maya's employee tells Karan about Naren's crush on Maya.  Karan becomes suspicious of Naren, who had previously claimed to not know Maya very well. Karan finds incriminating evidence against Naren, who does not have an alibi for the 10th.</p>

<p>Maya apologizes to Naren when she finds out that her employee told Karan that Naren has a crush on  Maya.  She told him that she clarified that there is nothing romantic between the two.  A heartbroken Naren goes to the police station and confesses to Ajit's murder, saying he did it at Maya's behest.</p>

<p>Naren starts to frame himself as delusional.  He has set up evidence against himself.  Maya confirms the evidence, including cryptic messages sent to Maya.  The murder weapon is also found in Naren's house.  Karan accepts that Naren killed Ajit in a delusional state to protect Maya and Tara.</p>

<p>A guilt-ridden Maya asks Naren why he took the blame for her.  Naren tells her that he had spent 10 years of his life on one of the Millennium Prize Problems, which he solved.  However someone else has reached the solution 46 hours before him.  Depressed, he was going to commit suicide.  Right then, Maya had knocked on Naren's door, giving him a new lease on life.</p>

<p>In a flashback, it shows how Naren covered up the murder. Since Ajit's murder occurred on the 9th and Maya did not have an alibi for the 9th, he killed a homeless man on the 10th on a day Maya and Tara had meticulously created an alibi.  Karan had previously noted that the burned remains had a smashed face and burned fingerprints to hide Ajit's identity so the dead body would not be connected to Maya.  In reality, it was done to make sure that no one would realize that the dead body was not Ajit's.</p>

<p>Naren is sentenced to 25 years in prison, which he used to solve another of the Millennium Prize Problems.</p>

<p>Saibal Chatterjee from NDTV rated 3.5 out of 5 stars praising the plot of the film and called, "With the writer-director, the technicians, the music team and the actors at their very best, <i>Jaane Jaan</i> is an all-round triumph." Devesh Sharma from <i>Filmfare</i> rated 3.5/5 stars and wrote, "The film rests hugely on the shoulders of its three principal protagonists. You tend to sympathise with the protagonists, wanting them to win, wanting them to stretch their bluff till the very end. Watch the film for the masterful performances by Varma, Ahlawat and Kapoor Khan". Rishil Jogani from <i>Pinkvilla</i> rated 3.5/5 stars and opined, "<i>Jaane Jaan</i> is a great adaptation of the book, 'The Devotion Of Suspect X'. It is a must watch for those who enjoy films in the thriller space. It is also strongly recommended for all those who haven't read the book or watched the Japanese adaptation of the book."</p>

<p>Sukanya Verma from <i>Rediff</i> rated 3.5/5 stars and opined, "In <i>Jaane Jaan</i>, the director sets the rules where subtext is spoiler and everybody must reveal themselves without disclosing anything. All his three lead actors rise to that challenge spectacularly and share numerous stories to be read in between the lines." Anvita Singh from <i>India Today</i> rated 3.5/5 stars and stated, "When you have a solid screenplay to rely on, it is half the battle won for everyone involved. Then all you need to do is cast the right actors. In '<i>Jaane Jaan's</i>' case, both these demands were met by Sujoy Ghosh ably." <i>Bollywood Hungama</i> rated the film 3 stars and stated, "<i>Jaane Jaan</i> is a gripping film and works due to the execution, unexpected twists and turns and terrific performances of Kareena Kapoor Khan, Jaideep Ahlawat and Vijay Varma."</p>

<p><i>Times of India</i> rated with 3/5 stars and wrote, "If you have an affinity for the kind of cinema that exudes a melancholic, enigmatic, and contemplative atmosphere, <i>Jaane Jaan</i> will strike a chord with you. However, the film falls short of keeping up with the grip and fast pace of the book that was unputdownable." Lachmi Deb Roy from <i>First Post</i> rated 3/5 stars and wrote, "The story is unique, engaging and the best thing about it is the minute details that he has paid attention to starting from the look of the apartments to the look of the actors. Kapoor have done justice to her role trying to show the hardships of a single mother and the stress that she goes through because of her dark past. both Ahlawat and Varma have slayed their roles to perfection."</p>
