An influential figure in contemporary popular music, she is noted for her four-octave vocal range and whistle register that has garnered critical acclaim. Grande has received numerous accolades throughout her career, including two Grammy Awards, one Brit Award, one Bambi Award, two <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, three American Music Awards, nine MTV Video Music Awards, and 30 Guinness World Records.</p>

<p>Grande began her music career at age 15 in the 2008 Broadway musical <i>13</i>. She rose to fame for playing Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series <i>Victorious</i> (2010–2013) and <i>Sam &amp; Cat</i> (2013–2014). Grande signed with Republic Records in 2011 after label executives viewed YouTube videos of her covering songs. Her 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&amp;B debut album, <i>Yours Truly</i> (2013), topped the US <i>Billboard</i> 200, while its lead single, "The Way", reached the top ten of the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Grande's voice and vocal performances on the album drew immediate comparisons to Mariah Carey.</p>

<p>Grande continued to explore pop and R&amp;B in her second and third studio albums, <i>My Everything</i> (2014) and <i>Dangerous Woman</i> (2016). <i>My Everything</i> experimented with EDM and achieved global success with its singles "Problem", "Break Free" and "Bang Bang", while <i>Dangerous Woman</i> became her first of four consecutive number-one albums in the UK. Personal struggles influenced her trap-infused fourth and fifth studio albums, <i>Sweetener</i> (2018) and <i>Thank U, Next</i> (2019), both of which were critical and commercial successes. <i>Sweetener</i> won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, and <i>Thank U, Next</i> broke the record for the largest streaming week for a pop album and was nominated for Album of the Year. The singles "Thank U, Next", "7 Rings", and "Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored" made Grande the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Hot 100 simultaneously and the first woman to succeed herself at the top of the UK Singles Chart. Her 2020 collaborations "Stuck with U" with Justin Bieber and "Rain on Me" with Lady Gaga helped her break the record for most number-one debuts on the Hot 100, the latter winning the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. Grande expanded on the trap genre with her sixth studio album, <i>Positions</i> (2020), which both the album and its title track debuted at number one in the UK and the US. Her collaborations with The Weeknd on the remixes of "Save Your Tears" and "Die for You" garnered her sixth and seventh US number-one singles, respectively.</p>

<p>Grande is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 90 million records globally and all her studio albums certified platinum or higher.

<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Grande was born in Boca Raton, Florida. She is the daughter of Joan Grande, the Brooklyn-born CEO of Hose-McCann Communications, a manufacturer of communications and safety equipment owned by the Grande family since 1964, and Edward Butera, a graphic design firm owner in Boca Raton. Grande is of Italian descent and has described herself as an Italian American with Sicilian and Abruzzese roots. She has an older half-brother, Frankie Grande, who is an entertainer and producer. Her family moved from New York to Florida before her birth, and her parents separated when she was eight or nine years old. Grande has a close relationship with her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Grande.</p>

<p>When her parents were Florida Panthers season ticket holders, she was accidentally hit on each wrist by errant hockey pucks on two different occasions in 1998, sustaining minor bruises both times. The second occurrence happened during the Panthers' inaugural regular-season game at National Car Rental Center on October 9, 1998, in which she was also the first child to ever ride a Zamboni in the brand-new arena during the first intermission, the result of her parents' $200 winning bid at an auction. A photograph of her on the Zamboni was featured in the <i>South Florida SunSentinel</i> the next day. At age 8, she sang "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the Panthers' home game against the Chicago Blackhawks on January 16, 2002.</p>

<p>As a young child, Grande performed with the Fort Lauderdale Children's Theater, playing her first role as the title character in the musical <i>Annie</i>. She also performed in their productions of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> and <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>. At age eight, she performed at a karaoke lounge on a cruise ship and with various orchestras such as South Florida's Philharmonic, Florida Sunshine Pops and Symphonic Orchestras. During this time, she attended the Pine Crest School and later North Broward Preparatory.</p>



<h2>Career</h2>
<h3>2008–2012: Career beginnings and Nickelodeon</h3>
<p>By age 13, Grande became serious about pursuing a music career, although she still concentrated on theater. When she first arrived in Los Angeles, California to meet with her managers, she expressed a desire to record an R&amp;B album: "I was like, 'I want to make an R&amp;B album,' They were like 'Um, that's a helluva goal! Who is going to buy a 14-year-old's R&amp;B album?!'" In 2008, Grande was cast as cheerleader Charlotte in the Broadway musical <i>13</i>. When she joined the musical, Grande left North Broward Preparatory School, but continued to be enrolled; the school sent her materials to study with tutors. She also sang various times at the New York City jazz club Birdland.</p>

<p>Grande was cast in the Nickelodeon television show <i>Victorious</i> along with <i>13</i> co-star Elizabeth Gillies in 2009. In the sitcom, set at a performing arts high school, she played the "adorably dimwitted" Cat Valentine. She had to dye her hair red every other week for the role, which severely damaged her hair. The show premiered in March 2010 to the second-largest audience for a live-action series in Nickelodeon, with 5.7 million viewers. The role helped propel Grande to teen idol status, but she was more interested in a music career, saying that acting is "fun, but music has always been first and foremost with me." Her character was compared to "Brittany Murphy's performance as the hapless Tai in <i>Clueless</i>" and described as being "very impressionable and easily swayed" but "generally sweet".</p>

<p>After the first season of <i>Victorious</i> wrapped, Grande wanted to focus on her music career and began working on her debut album in August 2010. To strengthen her vocal range, she began working with vocal coach Eric Vetro. The second season premiered in April 2011 to 6.2 million viewers, becoming the show's highest-rated episode. In May 2011, Grande appeared in Greyson Chance's video for the song "Unfriend You" from his album <i>Hold On 'til the Night</i> (2011), portraying his ex-girlfriend. She made her first musical appearance on the track "Give It Up" from the <i>Victorious</i> soundtrack in August 2011. While filming <i>Victorious</i>, Grande made several recordings of herself singing covers of songs by Adele, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, and uploaded them to YouTube. A friend of Monte Lipman, chief executive officer (CEO) of Republic Records, came across one of the videos. Impressed by her vocals, he sent the links to Lipman, who signed her to a recording contract. Grande voiced the title role in the English dub of the Spanish-language animated film <i>Snowflake, the White Gorilla</i> in November 2011. From 2011 to 2013, she voiced the fairy Princess Diaspro in the Nickelodeon revival of <i>Winx Club</i>.</p>

<p>In December 2011, Grande released her first single, "Put Your Hearts Up", which was recorded for a potential teen-oriented pop album that was never issued. She later disowned the track for its bubblegum pop sound, saying she had no interest in recording music of that genre. The song was later certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). On a second soundtrack, <i>Victorious 2.0</i>, released on June 5, 2012, as an extended play, she supplied vocals as part of the show's cast for the song "5 Fingaz to the Face". The third and final soundtrack, <i>Victorious 3.0</i>, was released on November 6, 2012, which featured a duet by Grande and Victoria Justice titled "L.A. Boyz", with an accompanying music video being released shortly after. In December 2012, Grande collaborated on the single version of "Popular Song", a duet with British singer and songwriter Mika.</p>

<p>After four seasons, <i>Victorious</i> was not renewed, with the finale airing in February 2013. Grande starred as Snow White in the pantomime-style musical theatre production <i>A Snow White Christmas</i> with Charlene Tilton and Neil Patrick Harris at the Pasadena Playhouse. She played Amanda Benson in <i>Swindle</i>, a 2013 Nickelodeon film adaptation of the children's book of the same name. Meanwhile, Nickelodeon created <i>Sam &amp; Cat</i>, an <i>iCarly</i> and <i>Victorious</i> spin-off starring Jennette McCurdy and Grande. Grande and McCurdy reprised their roles as Cat Valentine and Sam Puckett on the buddy sitcom, which paired the characters as roommates who form an after-school babysitting business. The pilot aired on June 8, 2013, and the network immediately picked up the show. The next month, Nickelodeon doubled <i>Sam &amp; Cat</i>'s original 20-episode order for season one, making it a 40-episode season. Despite its success in the ratings, the series was canceled after 35 episodes. The final episode aired on July 17, 2014.</p>

<h2>Artistry</h2>
<h3>Musical style</h3>
<p>Grande's music is generally pop and R&amp;B with elements of EDM, hip hop, and trap, the latter first appearing prominently on her <i>Christmas &amp; Chill</i> extended play. While consistently maintaining pop-R&amp;B tones, she has increased incorporation of trap into her music as her career has progressed, thanks to her work with record producer Tommy Brown. She has collaborated with Brown on every album thus far and stated that "one of the things I love most about working with Tommy is that none of the beats he plays me ever sound the same." Grande learned how to sound engineer and produce her own vocals because she "love[s] being hands on" with every project, revealing that Mac Miller taught her how to use the digital audio workstation Pro Tools. Collaborator Justin Tranter remarked that he felt inspired seeing how involved Grande is in creating her music "from the writing to the vision to the storytelling and to even engineering and comping her own vocals." She has co-written songs addressing a wide variety of themes, such as love, sex, wealth, breakups, independence, empowerment, self-love and moving on from the past.</p>

<p>Grande's debut album <i>Yours Truly</i> was complimented for recreating the R&amp;B "vibe and feel of the 90s" with the help of songwriter and producer Babyface. Her follow-up record, <i>My Everything</i>, was described as an evolution to a new sound exploring EDM and electropop genres. Grande expanded the pop and R&amp;B sound on her third album, <i>Dangerous Woman</i>, which was praised by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> for integrating elements of different styles, including reggae-pop ("Side to Side"), dance-pop ("Be Alright"), and guitar-trap fusion ("Sometimes"). Trap-pop is more heavily featured on her fourth and fifth studio albums, <i>Sweetener</i> and <i>Thank U, Next</i>. On <i>Sweetener</i>, Elias Leight of <i>Rolling Stone</i> opines that Grande "set her sights on conquering trap, savage basslines and jittery swarms of drum programming" and "embraces the sound of hard-bitten Southern hip-hop", exploring funk music with themes of love and prosperity. Craig Jenkins of <i>Vulture</i> noted that Grande changed her musical style to trap and hip hop with undertones of R&amp;B on <i>Thank U, Next</i>, with lyrics about breakups, empowerment, and self-love. Her sixth album, <i>Positions</i>, further explores the R&amp;B and trap-pop sound of <i>Sweetener</i> and <i>Thank U, Next</i>, with lyrics discussing sex and romance.</p>

<h3>Influences</h3>
<div><div><div><div>Grande credits Mariah Carey (<i>left</i>) and Whitney Houston (<i>right</i>) as her major vocal influences</div></div></div></div>
<p>Grande grew up listening mainly to urban pop and 1990s music. She credited Gloria Estefan with inspiring her to pursue a music career after Estefan saw and complimented Grande's performance on a cruise ship when she was eight years old. Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston are her biggest vocal influences: "I love Mariah Carey. She is literally my favorite human being on the planet. And of course Whitney [Houston] as well. As far as vocal influences go, Whitney and Mariah pretty much cover it." Alongside Carey and Houston, Grande's other key influences include Destiny's Child, Beyoncé, Celine Dion and Madonna. She reflects on her childhood by posting videos of herself singing songs from Dion's 1997 album <i>Let's Talk About Love</i> on her social media. Grande credits Madonna for "pav[ing] the way for me and also every other female artist" and admitted to being "obsessed with her entire discography".</p>

<p>Grande praised Imogen Heap's "intricate" song structure. She has named Judy Garland as a childhood influence, admiring her ability to tell "a story when she sings"; and says that "Over the Rainbow" was one of the first songs she remembers singing because "<i>Wizard Of Oz</i> was always my favorite movie when I was younger." Music producer and Grande collaborator Savan Kotecha has stated in multiple interviews that he and Grande were influenced by Lauryn Hill, when creating her fourth album <i>Sweetener</i>, as well as the song "No Tears Left to Cry". Kotecha told Variety "we were listening to Lauryn Hill about chord changes and why we stick to four chords all the time".</p>

<p>Musically, Grande admires India.Arie because her "music makes me feel like everything is going to be okay" and loves Brandy's songs because "her riffs are incredibly on point." She has also expressed admiration for rappers who impact the music industry without a planned release date, telling <i>Billboard</i>, "My dream has always been to be—obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does. I feel like there are certain standards that pop women are held to that men aren't. ... It's just like, 'Bruh, I just want to ... drop [music] the way these boys do." It inspired her to release "Thank U, Next" without any prior announcement, which <i>The Ringer</i> called "more of a Drake move than an Ariana Grande move."</p>

<h3>Voice</h3>
<p>Grande has been described as a soprano, possessing a four-octave vocal range and a whistle register. With the release of <i>Yours Truly</i>, critics compared Grande to Mariah Carey because of her wide vocal range, sound, and musical material. Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of <i>Billboard</i> wrote that both Carey and Grande have "the talent to let their vocals do the talking ... that's not where the similarities end. ... Grande is subverting it with cute, comfortable, and on-trend dresses with a feminine slant." Grande responded to the comparisons, "[I]t's a huge compliment, but when you hear my entire album, you'll see that Mariah's sound is much different than mine." Steven J. Horowitz of <i>Billboard</i> wrote in 2014, "With her sophomore album, the 'Problem' singer no longer resembles [Carey]—and that's okay."</p>

<p>Mark Savage of BBC News commented, "Grande is one of pop's most intriguing and gifted singers. A magnetic performer with unrivalled vocal control". In <i>The New York Times</i>, Jon Pareles wrote that Grande's voice "can be silky, breathy or cutting, swooping through long melismas or jabbing out short R&amp;B phrases; it's always supple and airborne, never forced." Composer and playwright Jason Robert Brown addressed Grande in a 2016 <i>Time</i> magazine article: "[N]o matter how much you are underestimated ... you are going to open your mouth and that unbelievable sound is going to come out. That extraordinary, versatile, limitless instrument that allows you to shut down every objection and every obstacle."</p>

<p>Grande cited Audrey Hepburn as a major style influence in her early years of fame, but began to find emulating Hepburn's style "a little boring" as her career progressed. She also drew inspiration from actresses of the 1950s and 1960s, such as Ann-Margret, Nancy Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe. Grande's modest look early in her career was described as "age appropriate" in comparison to contemporary artists who grew up in the public eye. Jim Farber of the <i>New York Daily News</i> wrote in 2014 that Grande received less attention "for how little she wears or how graphically she moves than for how she sings." That year, she abandoned her earlier style and began wearing short skirts and crop tops with knee-high boots in live performances and red carpet events. She also began regularly wearing cat and bunny ears. In recent years, she began wearing oversized jackets and hoodies. Grande's style is often imitated by social media influencers and celebrities. After years of dyeing her hair red for the role of Cat Valentine, Grande wore extensions as her hair recovered from the damage. Anne T. Donahue of MTV News noted that her "iconic" high ponytail has received more attention than her fashion choices.</p>

<p>Although Grande drew criticism for alleged impolite interactions with reporters and fans in 2014, she dismissed the reports as "weird, inaccurate depictions". <i>Rolling Stone</i> wrote: "Some may cry 'diva', but it's also Grande just taking a stand to not allow others to control her image." In July 2015, Grande sparked controversy after being seen on surveillance video in a doughnut shop licking doughnuts that were on display and saying "I hate Americans. I hate America. This is disgusting", referring to a tray of doughnuts. She subsequently apologized, saying that she is "EXTREMELY proud to be an American" and that her comments rather referred to obesity in the United States. She later released a video apology for "behaving poorly". The incident was parodied by <i>The Muppets</i> and featured in Miley Cyrus's <i>Saturday Night Live</i> cover of "My Way", about the regrets of the summer of 2015. Grande herself poked fun at the incident while hosting <i>Saturday Night Live</i> in 2016, saying, "A lot of kid stars end up doing drugs, or in jail, or pregnant, or get caught licking a doughnut they didn't pay for." In 2020, she said that she stopped doing interviews for a while out of fear that her words would be misconstrued and she would be labeled a "diva".</p>

<p>Grande has a large following on social media, and is one of the most influential celebrities on the internet. As of January2023, her YouTube channel has over 50 million subscribers, making her among the most subscribed solo female artist; her music videos have been viewed a total of over 24 billion times, with seven of them reaching one billion views; her Spotify profile has amassed over 85 million followers, making her the second most followed artist and most followed female; her Instagram account has over 380 million followers, making her the sixth most followed individual and third-most followed female; her now deactivated Twitter account had over 80 million followers, making it the seventh most followed account; her Facebook page has over 40 million followers, and her TikTok has 32.6 million followers.

As a feminist, Grande wrote a well-received, "empowering" essay on Twitter decrying the double standard and misogyny in the focus of the press on female musicians' relationships and sex lives instead of "their value as an individual".
