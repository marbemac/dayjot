<div>American television drama series</div>

<div>AmericanTV series or program</div>

<p><i><b>Billions</b></i> is an American drama television series created by Brian Koppelman, David Levien, and Andrew Ross Sorkin. The series premiered on January 17, 2016, on Showtime and its seventh and final season premiered on August 13, 2023.</p>

<p>Set primarily in New York and Connecticut, the series depicts hedge fund manager Bobby Axelrod (Damian Lewis) as he accumulates wealth and power in the world of high finance. Axelrod's aggressive tactics frequently garner the attention of United States Attorney Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti). Rhoades is based on Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan from 2009 to 2017, and the series was inspired by real-life federal prosecutions of financial crime. Bharara's 2013 prosecution of hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen of S.A.C. Capital Advisors loosely influenced the first season, while Salomon Brothers' 1991 manipulation of U.S. Treasury bonds inspired the second. Series subplots feature the psychiatrist turned performance coach Wendy Rhoades (Maggie Siff), market analyst Taylor Mason (Asia Kate Dillon), and Axelrod's right-hand man Mike "Wags" Wagner (David Costabile).</p>

<p>As the first American TV series to have a non-binary character (Taylor Mason), it has been nominated multiple times for the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Drama Series for its representation of the LGBTQ community.</p>



<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Chuck Roades (Giamatti) goes after hedge fund manager and popular philanthropist Bobby "Axe" Axelrod (Lewis). A collision course, with each using all of their considerable smarts and influence to outmaneuver the other, looms.</p>

<h3>Main</h3>
<ul><li>Paul Giamatti as Charles "Chuck" Rhoades, Jr.: U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who later attempts a run for governor of New York and is elected Attorney General of New York. Rhoades is ruthless and has a particular distaste for wealthy criminals who try to buy their way out of justice. Despite his significant power as U.S. Attorney, Rhoades struggles not to be overshadowed both by his higher-earning wife, Wendy, and by his well-connected, wealthy father. He went to Yale (as did his father) and has a blind trust of which his father is a trustee. In private, he is a sadomasochist and engages in BDSM role play with Wendy and other women, acting as a "slave." The character is loosely based on the careers of Preet Bharara and Eliot Spitzer.</li>
<li>Damian Lewis as Robert "Bobby" Axelrod (main season 1–5, &amp; 7): an ambitious billionaire manager of the hedge fund Axe Capital and a Hofstra University graduate who came from humble beginnings. He was one of his firm's survivors of the September 11 attacks, reforming it as Axe Capital and paying the college tuition of the children of his colleagues who died in the World Trade Center. He is extremely charitable and generous in public, but uses insider trading and bribery to grow his firm's enormous wealth. He has unique instincts that have led to a virtually infallible trading career. The character is loosely based on Steven A. Cohen and his former hedge fund S.A.C. Capital Advisors.</li>
<li>Maggie Siff as Wendy Rhoades: a psychiatrist, in-house performance coach at Axe Capital and wife of Chuck Rhoades, Jr. She is self-possessed, motivated, extremely successful and went to Yale. She has a strong relationship with Axelrod, her boss, with whom she has been working for more than 15 years. She participates with Chuck in BDSM role play activities and dominates Chuck.</li>
<li>Malin Åkerman as Lara Axelrod (starring season 1–3; guest season 4): wife and later ex-wife of Bobby Axelrod and a former nurse (who maintains her professional license).

<li>Kelly AuCoin as "Dollar" Bill Stearn (recurring seasons 1–3 &amp; 6; starring seasons 4–5, &amp; 7): a portfolio manager at Axe Capital with such loyalty to Axelrod that he would risk incriminating himself to save him. He was described by AuCoin as "the cheapest millionaire in America". Dollar Bill frequently resorts to insider trading and other legally dubious measures to create high returns for Axe Capital.</li>
<li>Corey Stoll as Michael Thomas Aquinas Prince (recurring season 5; starring season 6–7) a business magnate, grew up as small town Indiana farm boy, who seemingly wants to give back to society.

<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>The series was ordered by Showtime in March 2015, and the first season premiered January 17, 2016. On January 26, 2016, the series was renewed for the second season, which premiered on February 19, 2017. Showtime confirmed in April 2017 that Asia Kate Dillon, who is non-binary, would be a series regular in the third season. <i>Billions</i> is considered to be the first American TV series to have a non-binary character.</p>

<p>Preet Bharara, the inspiration for U.S. Attorney Chuck Rhodes who was portrayed by Paul Giamatti, was somewhat critical of Giamatti's casting – jokingly referring to the Italian American actor as "noted Indian American actor Paul Giamatti".</p>

<p>On May 8, 2019, the series was renewed for a fifth season by Showtime, which premiered on May 3, 2020. On October 1, 2020, Showtime renewed the series for a sixth season and Corey Stoll was promoted to series regular.

<h3>Depiction of BDSM</h3>
<p>The show captured the attention of the BDSM community, as it features numerous depictions of BDSM activity, and the two main characters of Charles "Chuck" Rhoades, Jr and his wife Wendy Rhoades engage in BDSM scenes numerous times in the early seasons of the show. In addition, season 4 of the show depicts the character of Chuck Rhoades coming out as a practitioner of BDSM in a public political speech. The show's producers retained the services of noted BDSM lifestyle expert Olivia Troy as a consultant to help ensure the activities are portrayed both accurately and safely.</p>

<h2>Lawsuits</h2>
<p><i>Billions</i> has faced several lawsuits regarding both copyright infringement and defamation.</p>

<p>The first, brought by Denise Shull and the ReThink group in 2019 (Shull v Sorkin), alleged (among other things) that <i>Billions</i> ripped off Shull's book and based character "Wendy Rhoades" on her likeness. She also argues that <i>Billions</i> engaged her as a consultant on the show, but did not compensate or credit her for her time, as Shull claims is illustrated in a recently released video. The case was dismissed, but has since been appealed. In July, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed a lower court's decision to dismiss the suit, saying that Shull's book and the show are not substantially similar.</p>

<p>The second, brought by the Cayuga Nation in 2020, argued that <i>Billions</i> defamed both the nation and its federal representative. In the show, the nation is depicted engaging in acts such as the illegal operation of a casino business, blackmail, and bribery. One of the Cayuga characters featured on the show had the same last name and occupation as a real-life member. The case was dismissed, but the Cayuga Nation is considering its options regarding appeals.</p>
