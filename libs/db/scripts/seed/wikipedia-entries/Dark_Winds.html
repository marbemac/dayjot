In Gallup, New Mexico, robbers pilot a helicopter to rob an armored truck, killing two guards. The fleeing helicopter flies over the nearby Navajo reservation, where it is seen by an older man named Hosteen Tso. Three weeks later, Tso is found dead in a motel room along with Anna Atcitty, the granddaughter of a Medicine Woman he was visiting due to ailments since seeing the helicopter. Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn of the Navajo Tribal Police investigates the murders; Tso's body is mutilated, while Anna's body is unmarked. Leaphorn has a personal history with Anna's family, which he does not disclose to his colleagues. The medicine woman is blind, and in a catatonic state since witnessing the murders. Leaphorn's wife, Emma, a nurse, convinces him to investigate the living conditions of a pregnant girl named Sally Growing Thunder, who visited her clinic. Leaphorn's deputy Bernadette Manuelito visits Sally's home but is intimidated by her mother, a witch, and convinced the woman cursed her. As Leaphorn begins his investigation, his department is joined by Deputy Jim Chee, who is, in reality, an undercover agent for the FBI. Agent Whitover, who was responsible for planting Chee, believes the armored truck robbery was committed by a Navajo radical group called the Buffalo Society and wants Chee to use the motel killings as a cover to investigate this lead on Navajo land. Leaphorn visits Tso's property, where he finds that his water supply has been contaminated - the helicopter is at the bottom of his reservoir with a dead body inside.</td></tr>

Flashbacks reveal that Anna Atcitty was dating Leaphorn's son Joe Jr., who worked at an oil drilling site with her father, Guy. At a Peyote ritual, a friend who had a premonitory vision warned Guy not to go to work that day. Guy warned several others, but not Joe Jr., who was killed in an explosion at the drilling site. Lester, the trading post owner, overhears the warning and tells Leaphorn about it. Leaphorn confronts Guy. The two fight. Leaphorn shoots Guy in the leg as he approaches with an axe. In the present, Leaphorn quickly identifies Jim Chee as an undercover FBI agent and convinces him to work as a double agent using the FBI's resources to assist in the double homicide case. Chee has water from Tso's property tested and confirms Leaphorn's suspicion that the helicopter is in Tso's well, and an autopsy report reveals that Anna was apparently "scared to death". Emma convinces Sally Growing Thunder to stay at the Leaphorns' home, believing her family's property is unsafe. The armored truck robbers revealed to include a man posing as Tso's Catholic priest grandson and a scarred man living on the Growing Thunder property, chase down and abduct a Mormon tourist family who unknowingly purchased a painting at a local gift shop where the money from the heist was stashed.</td></tr>
