<ul><li>Rosario Dawson as Ahsoka Tano:<br />A former Jedi Padawan, and apprentice to Anakin Skywalker. Dawson noted the character's montrals had been rebuilt with "technology that didn't even exist when we first started", resulting in them being longer and having a 3D-printed skeleton inside them that allowed for more fluid movement. Dawson worked with fight coordinator Ming Qiu to learn how to fight ambidextrously for the series.

Ahsoka loses a duel with Anakin and relives fragments of her past during the Clone Wars, during which she grows concerned that her legacy will only be one of fighting. Believing Anakin's teachings includes his legacy as Darth Vader, she initially refuses him, which leads to another duel between them.

<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>In December 2020, Lucasfilm announced several spin-off series from the Disney+ series <i>The Mandalorian</i>, including <i>Ahsoka</i> and <i>The Book of Boba Fett</i>; the spin-offs exist alongside <i>The Mandalorian</i> through interconnected stories, culminating in a "climactic story event", with <i>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</i> also being set in the same timeframe as <i>The Mandalorian</i> and <i>Ahsoka</i>. Each series was being concurrently developed by Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni, with Filoni creating, writing, and serving as lead producer and showrunner on <i>Ahsoka</i>. The series focuses on the character Ahsoka Tano, who was co-created by Filoni for the animated series <i>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</i> and made her live-action debut in the second season of <i>The Mandalorian</i>. By April 2022, Peter Ramsey was hired to direct at least one episode of the series, with Filoni also directing multiple episodes of the series. A year later, the rest of the directors were confirmed, which included Steph Green, Jennifer Getzinger, Geeta Patel, and Rick Famuyiwa. Filoni explained that the eight episodes of the season would be "relatively" similar in length to the previous episodes he worked on for <i>The Mandalorian</i> and <i>The Book of Boba Fett</i> (which ranged from 32 to 47 minutes), noting he hoped to keep them "moving" and make them "tight and fast because to make the action work, they've got to be shorter". Kathleen Kennedy, Carrie Beck, and Colin Wilson also serve as executive producers on the series.</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>The series begins after Ahsoka's appearances on <i>The Mandalorian</i> and <i>The Book of Boba Fett</i>, during which she is shown to be searching for Grand Admiral Thrawn, and Filoni said the series would tell a serialized story rather than having separate adventures in each episode. Filoni and Favreau consulted with <i>Thrawn</i> trilogy author Timothy Zahn regarding Thrawn's appearance in the series because the character is "his thing... [w]e want to make sure we get it right". Star Rosario Dawson confirmed in April 2023 that <i>Ahsoka</i> would continue the story established in the animated series <i>Star Wars Rebels</i>. Regarding <i>Ahsoka</i> being a continuation of <i>Rebels</i> or referred to as a fifth season of that series, Filoni said that was "interesting" and "one way of looking at it" explaining, "For me, when I'm telling those stories, I don't limit things like, 'Oh, well, I did it an animation, so I would do it distinctly different in live action.' There's just the story that it is, and I was telling it in one medium." Dawson and Beck believed Filoni had created the series' story in a way that all viewers would be able to follow the story and the relevant information from past series. Ahsoka's ambiguous ending in <i>Rebels</i> had been interpreted by Beck as being a "big open question" that provided many storytelling opportunities. Dawson had also been interested in the moment, saying that she had enjoyed the "idea that there was even another level to her". While discussing her transition, Dawson and Filoni had referenced <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> character Gandalf as he goes from Gandalf the Gray to Gandalf the White. The series initially begins with Ahsoka as a "wanderer", with Filoni noting that she had abandoned her role as a Jedi and had been skeptical of organizations of power, while saying "she walks a path that basically died out a long time ago". Filoni recognized that some audiences were already familiar with Ahsoka, while others were not, feeling she was "an interesting bridge between what came before and what's really possible". The series focuses on the themes of masters and apprentices, notably Sabine Wren's dynamic with Ahsoka, having earlier been her apprentice. <i>Ahsoka</i> is concurrent to the events of the third season of <i>The Mandalorian</i>.</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<p>With the series' announcement in December 2020, Rosario Dawson was confirmed to be reprising her role as Ahsoka Tano from <i>The Mandalorian</i>. By August 2021, Lucasfilm was reportedly looking to cast an actress to play the <i>Rebels</i> character Sabine Wren in the series. In October, Hayden Christensen was set to reprise his role as Anakin Skywalker, and Natasha Liu Bordizzo was cast as Wren by November. Later that month, Ivanna Sakhno joined the cast in an undisclosed role. In January 2022, Mary Elizabeth Winstead joined the cast in an undisclosed role, and the following month, Ray Stevenson joined the cast as an admiral. Stevenson previously voiced the character Gar Saxon in <i>Rebels</i> and <i>The Clone Wars</i>. Bordizzo was officially announced to be playing Wren in May, when other <i>Star Wars Rebels</i> characters were revealed to be appearing in the series including Hera Syndulla and Chopper. She had received news of her casting while filming <i>Day Shift</i> (2022). In September 2022, it was revealed that Eman Esfandi was cast as Ezra Bridger in the series. Mena Massoud had been rumored to be playing the character in the series, and stated after Esfandi's casting was revealed that he had auditioned for the role but the casting process had not gone further.</p>

<p>At <i>Star Wars</i> Celebration Europe in April 2023, it was revealed that Winstead was portraying Hera Syndulla, Sakhno was portraying Shin Hati, and Stevenson was portraying Baylan Skoll. Additionally, Genevieve O'Reilly, Diana Lee Inosanto, David Tennant, and Lars Mikkelsen were reprising their roles as Mon Mothma, Morgan Elsbeth, the voice of the droid Huyang, and Grand Admiral Thrawn, respectively, while various senators were portrayed by Maurice Irvin, Jacqueline Antaramian, Nelson Lee, and Erica Duke. The production team had kept Mikkelsen's involvement secret until the 2023 <i>Star Wars</i> Celebration; Mikkelsen had previously denied reprising the role before being confirmed for the series. Filoni had vaguely alluded to the possibility of him reprising his role as Thrawn in 2020, and later contacted him about the role for the series the next year. Additionally, it was revealed that Wes Chatham was appearing in the series as Enoch, Thrawn's "right-hand man". Anthony Daniels reprises his role as the droid C-3PO.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The first episode features an opening crawl, the first of the <i>Star Wars</i> Disney+ series to do so, after the crawls were previously reserved for the Skywalker Saga films. Unlike the crawl for those films, the <i>Ahsoka</i> one features red text and different formatting. The Loth-cats were animatronics created by Legacy Effects; their previously live-action appearances in <i>The Mandalorian</i> were done through CGI. The series' end credits feature a design reminiscent of the golden sphere and subsequent star map Elsbeth uses to search for Thrawn, and feature stylized Loth-wolves and Purrgil. Molly Edwards of <i>Total Film</i> also noted the credits had similarities to the World Between Worlds, as featured in <i>Rebels</i>, such as the text seen in the credits, with that realm ultimately appearing in the series. Baylan Skoll and Shin Hati wield lightsabers with a more orange color than the "stark red" usually depicted for <i>Star Wars</i> antagonists. Filoni said this choice was "very intentional" and was done to indicate that the two "might not straight up be what you think they are" at the start of the series. While not a straight orange color, Filoni likened what was chosen to his memory of Darth Vader's lightsaber in the original trilogy that "kind of fluctuated from visual effects" to have a more orange color.</p>

<h3>Filming</h3>
<p>Principal photography began on May 9, 2022, in Los Angeles, California, under the working title <i>Stormcrow</i>, with Eric Steelberg and Quyen Tran serving as cinematographers. The series used the StageCraft virtual production technology. Tennant recorded an early version of his part ahead of filming so the cast was able to perform with him. Episodes were shot simultaneously with two crews. Filming lasted six months and wrapped that October.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>In April 2023, during <i>Star Wars</i> Celebration London, it was revealed that Kevin Kiner would compose the score for <i>Ahsoka</i>, after previously composing the music for the animated series <i>The Clone Wars</i>, <i>Rebels</i>, <i>The Bad Batch</i>, and <i>Tales of the Jedi</i>. Sean Kiner, Deana Kiner and David Glen Russell provide additional music for the series.</p>

<p>Walt Disney Records released the score for <i>Ahsoka</i> in two volumes: music from the first four episodes, including the in-universe song "Igyah Kah", which was co-written by Kevin Kiner, Ludwig Göransson, Deana Kiner and Noah Gorelick, and features vocals by Sarah Tudzin, was released digitally on September 15, 2023 as part of the first volume.
