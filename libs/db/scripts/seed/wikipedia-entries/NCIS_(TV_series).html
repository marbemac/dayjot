<div>AmericanTV series or program</div>

<p><i><b>NCIS</b></i> is an American military police procedural television series and the first installment in the <i>NCIS</i> media franchise. The series revolves around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, combining elements of the military drama, police procedural genres, and comedy. The concept and characters were initially introduced in two episodes of the CBS series <i>JAG</i> (season eight episodes 20 and 21: "Ice Queen" and "Meltdown"). A spin-off from <i>JAG</i>, the series premiered on September 23, 2003, on CBS. To date, it has entered into the 20th full season and has gone into broadcast syndication on the USA Network. Donald P. Bellisario and Don McGill are co-creators and executive producers of the premiere member of the <i>NCIS</i> franchise. As of 2022, <i>NCIS</i> is the third-longest-running scripted, nonanimated U.S. prime-time TV series currently airing, surpassed only by <i>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</i> (1999–present) and <i>Law &amp; Order</i> (1990–2010; 2022–present); it is the seventh-longest-running scripted U.S. prime-time TV series overall.</p>

<p>The series originally had the partly redundant title <i><b>Navy NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service</b></i>; this was later shortened to <i><b>NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service</b></i> and then to <i>NCIS</i>. In season six, a two-part episode led to a spin-off series, <i>NCIS: Los Angeles</i>. A two-part episode during the 11th season led to a second spin-off series, <i>NCIS: New Orleans</i>. Though initially slow in the ratings, barely cracking the top 30 in the first two seasons, the third season showed progress, consistently ranking in the top 20, and by its sixth season, it became a top-five hit, having remained there since. In 2011, <i>NCIS</i> was voted America's favorite television show in an online Harris Poll. At the end of its 10th season, the series was the most-watched television series in the U.S. during the 2012–13 network television season. <i>NCIS</i> is on its 20th season. On February 21, 2023, <i>NCIS</i> was renewed for a 21st season.</p>



<h2>Premise</h2>
<p><i>NCIS</i> is an American police procedural drama television series, revolving around a fictional team of special agents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service responding to high visibility crimes.  NCIS is the primary federal law-enforcement agency of the United States Department of the Navy, which investigates criminal activities (e.g. deaths, force protection, treason, etc.) involving the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps and their families. Based at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., the NCIS Major Case Response Team was led until his suspension late in season 18 by Supervisory Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, a former Marine Corps gunnery sergeant scout sniper and a skilled investigator. Supervisory Special Agent Alden Parker, a former FBI special agent, now leads the team following his appointment early in season 19.</p>

<h2>Production</h2>
<img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/NCIS_Filming_%288_March_2009%29.jpg/220px-NCIS_Filming_%288_March_2009%29.jpg" height="165" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/NCIS_Filming_%288_March_2009%29.jpg/330px-NCIS_Filming_%288_March_2009%29.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/NCIS_Filming_%288_March_2009%29.jpg/440px-NCIS_Filming_%288_March_2009%29.jpg 2x" />A look at behind the scenes filming in 2009

<h3>Title</h3>
<p>Before the launch of the first season, advertisements on CBS identified the show as "Naval CIS". By the time of the launch of the first episode, <i>NCIS</i> was airing under the name <i>Navy NCIS</i>, the name it held for the entire first season. Since the "N" in NCIS stands for "Naval", the name "Navy NCIS" was redundant. The decision to use this name was reportedly made by CBS, over the objections of Bellisario, who preferred the old title because he felt it would:</p>
<ul><li>Attract new viewers (particularly those of <i>JAG</i>), who might not know the NCIS abbreviation</li>
<li>Distinguish between NCIS and the similarly themed and similarly spelled CBS series <i>CSI</i> and its spinoffs. (The original title, for instance, was often misquoted and parodied as "Navy CSI", something the show itself referenced in the first episode.)</li></ul>

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>In 2011, <i>NCIS</i> was voted America's favorite television show in an online Harris poll. <i>NCIS</i> finished its 10th season as the most-watched television series in the U.S. during the 2012–13 network television season. Diona Reasonover joined the main cast in season 16, following the departures of Duane Henry and Pauley Perrette. <i>NCIS</i> was renewed for a seventeenth season on April 11, 2019, which premiered on September 24, 2019, and for an eighteenth season in May 2020. The season premiered on November 17, 2020.</p>

<h3>Flair</h3>
<p>From the season two episode "Lt. Jane Doe" onwards, the series began showing two-second-long black-and-white clips. These clips (called "phoofs") are shown at the beginning of every segment depicting the last two seconds of that segment, a segment being the five or six portions of the show meant to be separated by commercials. Additionally, starting with the season three premiere, "Kill Ari (Part I)," a freeze-frame shot was also used at the very end of most episodes as well.</p>

<h3>Crew changes</h3>
<p>It was reported in May 2007 that Donald P. Bellisario would be stepping down from the show. Due to a disagreement with series star Mark Harmon, Bellisario's duties as showrunner/head writer were to be given to long-time show collaborators, including co-executive producer Chas. Floyd Johnson and Shane Brennan, with Bellisario retaining his title as executive producer. In fall 2009, Gary Glasberg joined the crew and became the new "day-to-day" runner of <i>NCIS</i> because Shane Brennan had to focus on his new show, the spin-off <i>NCIS: Los Angeles</i>. On September 28, 2016, Glasberg died in his sleep at the age of 50.</p>

<h3>Other releases</h3>
