<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>Muthuvel Pandian is a retired police officer who lives in Kodambakkam with his family. Muthuvel's son ACP Arjun is investigating Varman, an eccentric gangster operating from his base of operations in Arakkonam, who smuggles idols of gods and sells them to buyers overseas. Arjun confronts Varman's henchman Seenu and demands him about the whereabouts of Varman. While getting closer in nabbing Varman, Arjun suddenly goes missing and the police department covers up his murder by spreading word that he may have committed suicide due to the stress in the job. </p>

<p>Grieving the loss of his son and partly blaming himself for raising him to be honest and fearless, Muthuvel goes after Seenu and murders him, disposing the body by coercing a clueless local taxi driver Vimal into helping him. Varman’s men attempt to kill Muthuvel's grandson  Rithvik, but Muthuvel manages to save him. Muthuvel tries to convince Varman to leave him and his family alone, but to no avail. </p>

<p>Enraged, Muthuvel decides to fight back. First, he blackmails a psychiatrist Dr. S. Dhandapani into providing asylum for his family. Muthuvel then visits Narasimha, a reformed criminal living in Mandya, who loans him four of his sharpest shooters. 
With the help of Narasimha’s men, Muthuvel steals Varman's idols that were being smuggled and uses them to blackmail and humiliate Varman, who was about to kill his family. In retaliation, Varman tells a Bihari gangster named Kamdev to send people to kill Muthuvel and his family at his home, but Muthuvel and Narasimha's men finishes them off. On discovering Varman's target to be Muthuvel, Kamdev reveals to him that Muthuvel was the former ruthless and charismatic jailer of Tihar prison who disciplined the criminals harshly but also helped them reform, thus gaining a massive network of allies, including Kamdev. </p>

<p>Muthuvel corners Varman in his base along with a hundred men sent by another former criminal Sikandar Singh, but Varman reveals that Arjun is still alive and threatens to kill him. Both of them ultimately arrive at a compromise: Varman will release Arjun in exchange for retrieving a famous antique crown that is currently secure in a temple in Mangalagiri. Muthuvel plans a heist involving the Telugu actor Blast Mohan, who is a trustee of the temple where the crown is held. After various deceptions and with the help of a smuggler in Mumbai named Mathew, Muthuvel eventually comes into possession of the crown and sends it to Varman, but it is later revealed that the crown which Muthuvel sent was a fake. </p>

<p>Varman frees Arjun, who reveals himself as a corrupt police officer wanting to be cut in on Varman's operations, willing to kill his own father for money. However, the fake crown also conceals a hidden camera and their entire conversation is seen by Muthuvel. He attacks Varman's hideout with Kamdev, Vimal, and his allies, killing Varman and his men, while Narasimha protects Muthuvel's family and Mathew destroys Varman’s smuggling operations. Muthuvel gives Arjun one last chance to surrender, but he refuses and attempts to kill him. Arjun is shot and killed by Narasimha's men, while Muthuvel solemnly walks away.</p>

Janaki K of <i>India Today</i> gave 3 out of 5 stars and wrote "With solid performances and good camera work, <i>Jailer</i> is strictly a theatre watch." Gopinath Rajendran of <i>The Hindu</i> wrote "<i>Jailer</i> might be far from perfect, but with the towering presence of Rajinikanth standing tall along with Nelson’s fortified writing, this is a commendable comeback for both the actor and filmmaker." Kirubhakar Purushothaman of <i>The Indian Express</i> gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote "[the] Nelson Dilipkumar film is Rajinikanth's version of Kamal Haasan's <i>Vikram</i>, but with a twist. Saying that doesn't take away anything from this fun-filled entertainer.</p>

<p>Manoj Kumar of <i>OTTPlay</i> gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote "<i>Jailer</i> is a highly entertaining crowd-pleaser. Nothing path-breaking but it is sure to become an enjoyable delight for the masses." Pratikshya Mishra of <i>The Quint</i> gave 3 out of 5 stars and wrote "Without Rajinikanth, <i>Jailer</i> might not have had the same magnetism as it does but since the star is on screen, flicking his shades and throwing lighters in the air, it’s a whole different story." Priyanka Sundar of <i>Firstpost</i> gave 3 out of 5 stars and wrote "One of the most memorable things about Nelson’s directorial <i>Jailer</i>, starring Rajinikanth, is the fact that the superstar doesn’t get into a zone where he performs unbelievable action sequences".</p>
