<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>In April 2015, Warner Bros. Pictures announced it had acquired the film rights to the <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i> video game franchise with Roy Lee, David Katzenberg, and Seth Grahame-Smith set to produce the adaptation. Grahame-Smith stated that they would collaborate with franchise creator Scott Cawthon "to make an insane, terrifying and weirdly adorable movie". In July 2015, Gil Kenan signed to direct the film from a screenplay co-written with Tyler Burton Smith.</p>

<p>In March 2017, Cawthon tweeted announcing Blumhouse Productions as the film's new production company after Warner Bros. Pictures put the project in turnaround. In May 2017, producer Jason Blum said he was excited and working closely with Cawthon on the film. In June 2017, Kenan said he was no longer directing the film.</p><p>

In February 2018, Chris Columbus was announced as Kenan's replacement as director and writer, besides producing the film alongside Blum and Cawthon. In August 2018, Cawthon revealed that the first draft of the film's script, which he wrote with co-author of the <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i> novel trilogy, Kira Breed-Wrisley, was completed, and it would involve the events of the series' first game. That same month, Blum wrote on Twitter that the film was aiming for a 2020 release. In November, Cawthon announced that he scrapped the script, despite being liked by Columbus and Blum, as he "had a different idea for [the story], one that I liked better". It contributed to a further delay to the film, for which Cawthon took full responsibility. In June 2020, during an interview with Fandom, Blum, when asked about the progress of the film, stated:</p><blockquote><p>"It's super active, so I really feel like we have a very good shot at seeing a <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i> movie...I feel like it's really moving forward; it's not stalled or anything else. It's moving forward rapidly. I don't want to put a timeline on it, but soon we'll get a movie. I feel really confident about that."</p></blockquote>

<p>In September 2021, Blum revealed that Columbus was no longer involved with the project, but it was still in active development. In August 2022, Blum announced that Jim Henson's Creature Shop would be working on the animatronic characters for the film. In October, Emma Tammi was announced as Columbus' replacement as director, in addition to co-writing the screenplay alongside Cawthon and Seth Cuddeback.</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<p>In December 2022, Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lillard joined the cast in undisclosed roles. <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i>-related YouTuber Dawko later revealed during a livestream that Hutcherson would portray the first game's security guard Mike Schmidt and Lillard would portray the franchise's main villain William Afton. He also revealed that Mary Stuart Masterson and Piper Rubio joined the cast as Mike's aunt Jane, and Mike's younger sister Abby, respectively. In March 2023, it was reported that Kat Conner Sterling and Elizabeth Lail were cast in the film. Lucas Grant and Jessica Blackmore have undisclosed roles.</p>

<p>Mark Fischbach was contacted to have a role in the film, but turned it down due to a conflicting schedule with his own film <i>Iron Lung</i>.</p>

<h3>Filming</h3>
<p>Principal photography was initially set to begin in March 2021. However, due to script issues, filming was delayed. Filming began in New Orleans on February 1, 2023, under the working title <i>Bad Cupcake</i>, with an estimated production budget, before tax incentives, of $25 million, and wrapped on April 3. Lillard began filming his scenes in mid-February.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>The Newton Brothers composed the film's score.</p>

It was released two days earlier on October 25, 2023 in the United Kingdom.</p>

<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>In October 2023, a pop-up location in Los Angeles, California was built at Sunset Boulevard.

<h2>Reception</h2>

<h3>Box office</h3>
<p>In the United States and Canada, the film is projected to gross around $50 million from 3,550 theaters in its opening weekend.</p>

<h3>Critical response</h3>
<p>On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 31% of 51 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.5/10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 29 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.</p>

<p>Murtada Elfadl writing for <i>Variety</i> thought there were not enough use of the animatronic creatures, instead focusing on "a baffling plot and backstory for their protagonist". He also criticized the lack of jump scares and ended his review saying, "In trying to adapt the game for the screen, they forgot what makes the original special, wringing unintentional laughter from its bizarre story instead of entertaining audiences". Dylan Roth of <i>The New York Observer</i> gave the film a score of one out of five and wrote, "There are jump scares, but no real thrills. There are jokes, but no genuine laughs".</p>

<p>Meagan Navarro of Bloody Disgusting gave a score of three out of five and wrote, "It's the type of handsomely made, charming creature feature that'll play well at slumber parties or rowdy theaters full of obsessed fans, which is precisely its target audience. <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i> won't scare the pants off of seasoned horror fans; the animatronic denizens of Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria will likely make you want to hug them instead". <i>Total Film</i>'s Neil Smith scored the film a two out of five and ended his review, "With robot heads containing flesh-mangling chainsaws, faces resembling that of battle-scarred Terminators, and the lumbering gait of Romero zombies, Freddy Fazbear and his pals would seem precision-tooled for terror. Sadly, though, they are about as scary as Barney the purple dinosaur in what is ultimately a ploddingly predictable, gore-lite yawner".</p>



<h2>Future</h2>
<p>In August 2018, Cawthon said that if the first film were to be successful, there could be a second and third film, following the events of the second and third games, respectively. In January 2023, in an interview on the podcast <i>WeeklyMTG</i>, Lillard revealed he signed a three-picture deal with the studios.</p>
