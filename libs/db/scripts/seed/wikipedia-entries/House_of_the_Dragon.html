<p><i><b>House of the Dragon</b></i> is an American fantasy drama television series created by George R. R. Martin and Ryan Condal for HBO. A prequel to <i>Game of Thrones</i> (2011–2019), it is the second television series in the <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i>, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the "Dance of the Dragons".</p>

<p><i>House of the Dragon</i> received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020 and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season.</p>

<p>The first season received highly positive reviews, with praise towards its character development, visual effects, writing, score by Ramin Djawadi, and performances (particularly Considine, Smith, D'Arcy, Alcock, and Cooke). However, the pacing, specifically of the time jumps, and the dark lighting of some scenes were criticized. The series premiere was watched by over 10 million viewers across the linear channels and HBO Max on the first day, the biggest in HBO's history. At the 80th Golden Globe Awards, <i>House of the Dragon</i> won Best Television Series – Drama and D'Arcy was nominated for Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama. The series earned nine Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series, and won three British Academy Television Craft Awards.</p>

With both his sons dead, old King Jaehaerys I Targaryen convenes a Great Council to choose an heir. The Westerosi lords select Jaehaerys' eldest grandson, Prince Viserys, over Princess Rhaenys, the eldest grandchild. Nine years into his reign, King Viserys organizes a tournament to celebrate Queen Aemma Arryn's pregnancy, confident she is carrying his long-awaited male heir. The Small Council disregards Master of Ships Lord Corlys Velaryon's warning that the Triarchy, an alliance of Essos' Free Cities, threatens to cripple Westerosi shipping lanes. Hand of the King, Ser Otto Hightower, criticizes Viserys's brother and heir, Prince Daemon, for his brutality as the City Watch commander. At the tournament, the young, handsome Ser Criston Cole, a common-born knight, outcompetes Daemon. Meanwhile, Viserys sacrifices Aemma in childbirth, performing a C-section Aemma pleads against, and their newborn son, Baelon, dies shortly after. Viserys refuses the council's pleas to appoint a new heir until Otto reveals that Daemon mockingly styled Baelon as, "The Heir for a Day." Outraged, Viserys banishes Daemon from King's Landing and appoints his only living child, Princess Rhaenyra, heir to the Iron Throne, revealing to her Aegon the Conqueror's dream that inspired him to unify Westeros.</td></tr>

The Small Council dismisses this and Rhaenyra is instead relegated to appointing a new Kingsguard knight. Ignoring others' advice, she chooses Ser Criston, the only knight with actual battle experience. Ser Otto sends his teen-aged daughter, Lady Alicent, to privately console the grieving king; she advises that Viserys and Rhaenyra should discuss his kingly duty to remarry. Lord Corlys and his wife, Princess Rhaenys, propose that Viserys unite their Valyrian houses by marrying their twelve-year-old daughter, Laena. Meanwhile, the Small Council learns that Daemon, proclaiming himself the true heir, stole a dragon egg and intends to marry his mistress, Mysaria, as a secondary spouse. Otto and a small detachment sail to Dragonstone to retrieve the egg. Rhaenyra follows on her dragon, Syrax, and forces Daemon to renounce his false claims and give her the egg.

Meanwhile, brothers Hobert and Otto Hightower secretly scheme to make Aegon the successor, furthering their family's power and prestige. After Ser Vaemond Velaryon pleads for the king's help, Viserys agrees to send aid to the Stepstones.

Alicent tells Aegon he must prepare to one day dispute Rhaenyra’s claim for the Iron Throne, as he, Viserys’s firstborn son, will always be a threat to her claim, and his life would not be safe if she were to take the throne. Daemon and his wife, Laena Velaryon, visit Pentos with daughters Baela and Rhaena. The prince offers them a lordship in exchange for an alliance against a resurgent Triarchy. Unable to give birth after an agonizing labor, Laena commands her dragon Vhagar to incinerate her. Ser Criston, now serving Alicent, goads Ser Harwin into attacking him by implying that Harwin fathered Rhaenyra's children.

In November 2018, Martin stated that a "potential spin-off series would be solidly based on material in <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i>." <i>Game of Thrones</i> creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss stated they wanted to "move on" from the franchise and declined involvement in subsequent projects. By September 2019, a <i>Game of Thrones</i> prequel series from Martin and Ryan Condal that "tracks the beginning of the end for House Targaryen" was close to receiving a pilot order from HBO. The following month, <i>House of the Dragon</i> was given a straight-to-series order. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik, who won an Emmy Award for directing the episode "Battle of the Bastards", were selected to serve as showrunners. In 2016, Condal pitched the idea of a series based on Martin's <i>Tales of Dunk and Egg</i>, however HBO initially passed on it. Sapochnik was also hired to direct the series premiere as well as additional episodes. The series begins 172 years before the events of <i>Game of Thrones</i> during the reign of King Viserys I Targaryen, ultimately leading to the Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons. The project is a reworking of the rejected spin-off concept from <i>Game of Thrones</i> writer Bryan Cogman, on which HBO officially passed.</p>

<p>Inspiration for the series came from English medieval history and the Anarchy, a war of succession after the death of Henry I of England between his nephew Stephen of Blois and only surviving child, Empress Matilda, who had fled to Normandy in the 12th century. In January 2020, Casey Bloys, HBO's president of programming, stated that writing had begun. Writers for the show include Condal and Sara Hess, who previously wrote for <i>Deadwood</i> and <i>Orange Is the New Black</i>. Martin was also involved in the pre-production, providing input on storylines and reviewed scripts and rough cuts. On August 26, 2022, less than a week after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season. On August 31, Miguel Sapochnik stepped down as director and co-showrunner for the second season, but remained an executive producer. Sapochnik stated, "It was incredibly tough to decide to move on, but I know that it is the right choice for me, personally and professionally." Alan Taylor, who directed <i>Game of Thrones</i> episodes, will join in season two and serve as an executive producer and direct. Following the second season renewal, Bloys stated that it is expected to premiere in 2024. Hess told <i>Variety</i> in late December 2022 that most of season 2 had been written and will include a revenge plot against Alicent following the events of the first-season finale. The second season will consist of eight episodes.</p>

<h4>Changes from the novels</h4>
<div>

<blockquote>
<p>It was very important for Miguel and I to create a show that was not another bunch of white people on the screen. We wanted to find a way to put diversity in the show, but we didn't want to do it in a way that felt like it was an afterthought or, worse, tokenism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ryan Condal,July 2022 interview with <i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p>
</div>
<p>In the novels, members of House Velaryon are generally described as having "silver-gold hair, pale skin, and violet eyes", similar to the Targaryens. However, Condal and Sapochnik wanted to introduce more racial diversity with its casting. <i>Game of Thrones</i> was criticized for lacking a diverse cast and including cultural stereotypes. As a result, House Velaryon are portrayed as black in the television series. According to Condal, Martin, while writing the novels, considered making the Velaryons a house of Black aristocrats who traveled to Westeros from the culturally diverse area of Valyria. Despite initial fan criticism of the ethnicity change, publications and commentators stated it helped distinguish between the large number of characters between the two families.</p>

<p><i>Fire &amp; Blood</i> is written in the style of a history book authored by an in-universe fictional historian studying the Targaryen dynasty and various civil conflicts. The novels of <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>, however, are more immersive, with each chapter written in a third-person limited perspective from the immediate point of view of a character. As a result, some accounts of events recorded in <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i> are second-hand narrations that are potentially speculative or distorted, therefore making the narrator unreliable from the reader's perspective. In an effort to make the story more clear for viewers, the show writers decided to portray the book events in chronological order from a third-person perspective.</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>

<h4>Season 1</h4>
<p>Casting began in July 2020. In October 2020, Paddy Considine was cast as Viserys I Targaryen. Considine was offered a role in <i>Game of Thrones</i> but declined due to the fantasy elements of the series. Condal in a 2020 interview stated that Considine was their first choice for Viserys. By December, Olivia Cooke, Matt Smith, and Emma D'Arcy were cast as Alicent Hightower, Daemon Targaryen, and Rhaenyra Targaryen, respectively. In an interview with <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, Smith stated he was initially hesitant to star in a <i>Game of Thrones</i> prequel but accepted the role after learning of Considine's attachment to the project.</p>

<p>In February 2021, Rhys Ifans, Steve Toussaint, Eve Best, and Sonoya Mizuno were added to the main cast. By April, Fabien Frankel joined the cast as Ser Criston Cole. In May, Graham McTavish was spotted on set in full wardrobe. In July 2021, Emily Carey and Milly Alcock were added to the cast as younger counterparts of Alicent Hightower and Rhaenyra Targaryen, respectively. The time jump midway through the first season prompted the casting of multiple actors for the same role.</p>

<h4>Season 2</h4>
<p>On April 24, 2023, Gayle Rankin, Simon Russell Beale, Freddie Fox, and Abubakar Salim were announced to have joined the cast for the second season as Alys Rivers, Ser Simon Strong, Ser Gwayne Hightower and Alyn of Hull, respectively.</p>

<h3>Filming</h3>
<p>Principal photography on the ten-episode first season of the series began in April 2021. The series was filmed primarily in the United Kingdom. <i>House of the Dragon</i> was the first production to be shot at Warner Bros. Leavesden Studios' new virtual production stage. On July 18, 2021, a positive COVID-19 case forced the pausing of production for two days. The Spanish publication <i>Hoy</i> reported that <i>House of the Dragon</i> would be filmed in the Province of Cáceres in western Spain between October 11–21, 2021. The provincial capital of Cáceres along with the medieval town of Trujillo were used in scenes for King's Landing. From October 26–31, the series was filmed in Portugal at the Castle of Monsanto.</p>

<p>Locations in Cornwall, England included St Michael's Mount, Holywell Beach and Kynance Cove. Other locations included Castleton, Derbyshire, in areas such as Cave Dale, Eldon Hill Quarry and the Market Place. Some scenes were shot in Aldershot, Hampshire. In February 2022, HBO confirmed that the first season of <i>House of the Dragon</i> had wrapped production. Visual effects for the series were produced in part by Pixomondo, who worked on <i>Game of Thrones</i> and received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Visual Effects. In October 2022, it was reported that the OSVP stage at Leavesden Studios, used in the series, was shutting down.</p>

<p>The second season began filming on April 11, 2023, at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in Watford, England, and moved to Cáceres, Spain on May 18, 2023. The series is set to continue filming throughout the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Despite the show originating in the United States, the largely British cast works under local rules governed by the sister union Equity.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<div>Main article: House of the Dragon: Season 1 (soundtrack)</div>
<p>It was announced in February 2021 that Ramin Djawadi would compose the series score.
Djawadi composed the music for all eight seasons of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, which garnered him three Grammy Awards nominations and two Emmy Awards wins. Djawadi and the showrunners opted to retain the original theme song, "Game of Thrones Theme", for <i>House of the Dragon</i>. The song debuted in the opening credits of the second episode. In an interview with <i>The A.V. Club</i>, Djawadi stated that the original theme song was used to "tie the shows together". For the first season, Djawadi, along with Condal and Sapochnik, watched each episode and made notes on when the music should occur and what mood the music should set. Character motifs from <i>Game of Thrones</i> are also featured in <i>House of the Dragon</i>, including the Dragon theme "Dracarys".</p>

<h3>Language</h3>
<p><i>Game of Thrones</i> linguist David J. Peterson returned to continue his work on the constructed language High Valyrian. Peterson stated that, unlike <i>Game of Thrones</i>, <i>House of the Dragon</i> features scene-long dialogue in High Valyrian. In the series, High Valyrian is spoken by both Targaryens and Velaryons, requiring cast members to learn the language. Emma D'Arcy reportedly enjoyed learning it, while Matt Smith initially dreaded it and found it daunting.</p>

<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>The production budget of the first season of <i>House of the Dragon</i> was nearly $200 million, which equates to an average of under $20 million per episode. In comparison, its parent series, <i>Game of Thrones</i>, cost around $100 million per season, beginning with nearly $6 million per episode from seasons one to five, around $10 million for every episode in seasons six and seven, and up to $15 million each episode in its eighth and final season, earning $285 million in profits per episode over its eight seasons. According to <i>Deadline Hollywood</i>, the marketing budget was over $100 million, comparable to the budget for a blockbuster theatrical film.</p>



<h2>Release</h2>
<p><i>House of the Dragon</i> premiered on August 21, 2022. It is HBO's first new series to stream in 4K, Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos on its streaming platform HBO Max.

<p>Reviews for the first season were positive, with critics praising the writing, directing, score and cast performances. Lucy Mangan of <i>The Guardian</i> called the show a "roaring success" with Lorraine Ali of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> stating the show mirrors the acclaim of the early seasons of <i>Game of Thrones</i>. Reviews pointed out the reliance on Martin's novel was one of the reasons the series fared better critically than the later seasons of its predecessor, specifically the last season. The cast also received praise, with Paddy Considine, Matt Smith, Emma D'Arcy, and Olivia Cooke being singled out for their performances. In an interview with <i>GQ</i>, Considine stated that Martin told him that "Your Viserys is better than my Viserys". The diversity of the characters was mostly met with praise, with Jeff Yang of <i>The New York Times</i> stating that diversification of the cast can help the series gain a more diverse audience. The series was included on multiple critics' top ten television series lists of 2022, including <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, CNN, and <i>Polygon</i>.</p>

<p>Despite the praise, the show's first season did receive criticism for the depiction of violence, pacing and cinematography. Reviewing the early episodes, <i>Rolling Stone</i> and <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> said the series leaned too much on grand imagery and lacked the breakout supporting characters that <i>Game of Thrones</i> had<i>.</i> Before the premiere, Martin stated that the series is similar to a Shakespearean tragedy with each character being morally grey with no "character everybody's going to love". <i>The Guardian</i> stated the "dullness" of the characters makes the series more of a period drama than an action-adventure fantasy. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> and <i>The New York Times</i> cited the constant actor changes as a reason for the lack of emotional attachment to characters. The graphic violence in the season premiere with a failed caesarean section was criticized for being excessive and, according to <i>USA Today,</i> "exploitive and in poor taste". The time jumps throughout the first season were also noted for being jarring and causing confusion, while George R. R. Martin defended them as being "handled very well". In addition, the dark cinematography in Episode 7 was a point of criticism from both critics and fans alike. HBO responded that the dimmed lighting in those scenes was an "intentional creative decision". <i>Game of Thrones</i> faced similar criticism regarding the lighting of scenes in Season 8, with one of the show's cinematographers stating it was a "deliberate choice".</p>

<h3>Viewership</h3>
<p>The day after the series premiere, HBO said the episode had been viewed by an estimated 9.99 million viewers in the U.S. on its first night of availability – including linear viewers and streams on HBO Max – which it said was the largest single-day viewership for a series debut in the service's history, dethroning <i>Euphoria</i>. After one week of availability, the viewership rose to nearly 25 million in the U.S. across all platforms. Nielsen estimated that the episode was watched by 10.6 million viewers on HBO Max in the first four days, with the number increasing to 14.5 million when including the viewership on the main HBO channel. Samba TV meanwhile stated that 4.8 million U.S. households streamed the episode in the first four days. The series was also popular on social media, with the show premiere being the number one trending topic on Twitter and Google Trends.</p>

<p>The finale of the first season was watched by 9.3 million viewers across all platforms during its premiere night according to HBO, which was the highest viewership for any finale of a HBO show since the series finale of <i>Game of Thrones</i>. The show averaged 9–9.5 million viewers for an episode on premiere night and 29 million total viewers after a week of release.</p>

<p>Nielsen stated in November 2022 that 35% of the viewers of the show were in the age range of 18–34. Similar to <i>Game of Thrones</i>, the first season of <i>House of the Dragon</i> was extensively pirated. According to TorrentFreak, it was the most pirated series of 2022, ahead of <i>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</i> and other series.</p>

<h3>Comparisons with <i>The Rings of Power</i></h3>
<p>Critics, fans, and publications have drawn comparisons between <i>House of the Dragon</i> and fantasy series <i>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</i> on Amazon Prime Video. <i>The Rings of Power</i> is a prequel series set thousands of years before the events of J. R. R. Tolkien's <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, while <i>House of the Dragon</i> is a prequel series set before <i>Game of Thrones</i>. The similar fantasy genre, close release dates, and extensive fan bases were cited in articles comparing the two series. Commentators and fans alike have described these comparisons as the "biggest battle in TV history". More negative criticism from the two fan bases also included the character diversity, with some publications describing some of the criticism as racist. Martin stated that although he hopes both shows are successful, he wants to see <i>House of the Dragon</i> "succeed more." Lindsey Weber, an executive producer for <i>The Rings of Power</i>, stated that the head-to-head conflict between the two shows are "totally manufactured by the media for headlines". Show co-creator J. D. Payne said the only competition he sees is with "themselves"; however, he wishes well for "anyone else working on storytelling".</p>

<p>Financially, the budget for <i>The Rings of Power</i> is almost $450 million more than <i>House of the Dragon</i>. Both series fared successfully in the ratings. According to Nielsen and first-party data, <i>The Rings of Power</i>'s first two episodes had more than 1.25 billion minutes of streaming minutes after three days of availability. In comparison, a few hours after the episode two premiere of <i>House of the Dragon</i>, the show had reached more than 1.06 billion minutes of streaming minutes. Following the season finale for <i>House of the Dragon</i>, weekly streaming viewership passed 1 billion viewing minutes for the first time. According to Nielsen data, <i>The Rings of Power</i> has a higher percentage of older viewers, with more than 70% of viewers being over the age of 35. In any given week, <i>The Rings of Power</i>  tended to have more streams than <i>House of the Dragon</i> given that the viewership of <i>House of the Dragon</i> was split between those watching online and those watching on HBO channel while that of <i>The Rings of Power</i> was online only. However, following both series debuts, streaming viewership for <i>The Rings of Power</i> decreased over the first season, while <i>House of the Dragon</i> viewership increased. The viewership of individual episodes of <i>House of the Dragon</i> also tended to increase over a number of weeks after the episodes became available while that of <i>The Rings of Power</i> dropped sharply after the first two weeks. Despite the age gap in viewership, commentators have stated one of the reasons both shows did well was the consistent release schedule that helped create social-media buzz. Both shows have highlighted the "streaming wars" between both Amazon and HBO and the entertainment industry as a whole.</p>
