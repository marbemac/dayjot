<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>The Expendables are sent to Libya to prevent mercenary Suarto Rahmat from stealing nuclear warheads for a mysterious terrorist named Ocelot. The team is led by Barney Ross and formed by members Lee Christmas, Toll Road, and Gunner Jensen, with new members Easy Day and Galan. However, they are incapacitated when all of their vehicles are destroyed in the ensuing fight. When Rahmat shoots their plane down, the team finds what appears to be Barney's burned body in the wreckage, identified by his ring.</p>

<p>At Barney's memorial service, CIA operative Marsh reveals that the team will pursue Ocelot and Rahmat, but without Christmas, who jeopardized the mission trying to save Barney. He is replaced by Gina, his former lover, who also brings an operative named Lash into the team. The team travels to Asia, but is secretly tracked by Christmas, who had slipped Gina a tracking device earlier. Barney’s apparent death opened a sealed file which states that there is an eyewitness that could identify Ocelot. </p>

<p>Ocelot plans to provoke World War III by letting the nuclear warheads explode in the Russian Far East, transporting them on a ship disguised as an American aircraft carrier. As the Expendables and Marsh board the ship, they are ambushed and taken hostage. Marsh is taken away to negotiate a prisoner-exchange for the eyewitness.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Christmas travels to Thailand to recruit former Expendable Decha, who has turned towards pacifism but agrees to bring him to the ship to avenge Barney. As Christmas fights his way through the ship, Decha has a change of heart and helps him rescue the rest of the team. They launch an attack on Rahmat‘s forces, during which Christmas fights and kills him. However, Toll has been heavily wounded and needs immediate medical care. </p>

<p>During the prisoner exchange, Marsh is revealed to be Ocelot, hoping to financially profit from igniting World War III. While the team leaves on Decha's boat to save Toll, Christmas stays behind to turn the ship around to avoid a global conflict. He confronts Marsh, who is killed by Barney, who surprises everyone by revealing that he faked his own death, hoping to lure Ocelot out of hiding. They escape the nuclear explosion and celebrate with the team.</p>

<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>After <i>The Expendables 3</i> (2014) underperformed at the box office, the future of the series was left in doubt and production stalled over several years. By November 2014, it was announced that the project is being developed with intent to retain its R-rating like the first two films. In December 2016, Sylvester Stallone announced that the fourth installment will be the final film in the series, while a scheduled tentative release date was set for 2018. By March 2017, Stallone had left the project and the franchise, due to creative differences over the script and direction for continuing the franchise. In January 2018, after vocal support from other cast members (including Arnold Schwarzenegger), Stallone announced his return to the series with a post to his social media platforms; confirming new developments on the fourth movie.</p>

<p>By August 2020, Vértice Cine announced their involvement as a production studio on the movie, alongside Lionsgate and Millennium Films. They also revealed that Patrick Hughes will return to the series as director. In November 2020, the president of Millennium Media, Jeffrey Greenstein, stated that the studio is continuing to work on <i>The Expendables 4</i> after various delays within the industry worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2021, <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> reported that Scott Waugh would be directing the film, replacing Hughes, as well as Statham serving as a producer of the film, while Stallone confirmed his involvement with the project, and that <i>The Expendables 4</i> was the same project as <i>The Expendables: A Christmas Story</i>, previously reported as a spin-off but in fact the film's working-title during development. Stallone further stated that production was set to commence in October of that year. According to Dolph Lundgren, the film had a budget of $100 million.</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>In July 2018, Gregory Poirier announced his role as screenwriter. Production was tentatively scheduled to begin by April 2019, though it wasn't until July of that year that Stallone announced that he was continuing to work on the script for the project. The script was completed later that year, though negotiations with producers were ongoing. In August 2021, it was announced that Spenser Cohen wrote the most recent draft of the script with Max Adams, from a story by Cohen.</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<p>Over the years, multiple actors reported interest or claimed they were approached to star in a fourth installment. In March 2014, Pierce Brosnan stated that he had agreed with producer Avi Lerner to star in a fourth installment. By April of the same year, Sylvester Stallone revealed his first choice for the villain was Jack Nicholson, while mentioning his interest in convincing Clint Eastwood to join the production. According to Jackie Chan, he was approached to star in the film by Stallone but was unsure about having limited screen time in an ensemble film, which is why he had turned down roles in the previous two entries. Dwayne Johnson publicly expressed interest to play a villainous character in a new installment during a 2014 Q&amp;A and reiterated his interest to join the series in 2022. In May 2015, Hulk Hogan claimed that he was in talks with Stallone to play the film's main villain.</p>

<p>In June 2020, Jean-Claude Van Damme expressed interest in returning to the franchise, publicly pitching his idea of playing Claude Vilain, the brother to his villain character, Jean Vilain, from <i>The Expendables 2</i>. Despite discontent with how his character was handled in <i>The Expendables 3</i>, Arnold Schwarzenegger proclaimed he was interested in returning to the series if he liked the script. However; on May 29, 2023, Schwarzenegger confirmed that he would not be returning to the franchise, citing a general disinterest.
While he was not included in the fourth movie, Kellan Lutz proclaimed interest to return in a fifth installment in an Instagram post. On the other hand, Terry Crews, who had starred in all previous films, refused to appear in any new entries after claiming he was sexually assaulted by Stallone's agent, Adam Venit, alleging he was pressured by producer Avi Lerner to drop the case if he wanted to stay in the series.</p>

<p>However, none of the actors mentioned above were subsequently cast, and the cast was announced to include returning stars Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Randy Couture, and Dolph Lundgren, while new cast members were revealed to be Eddie Hall, Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson, Megan Fox, Tony Jaa, Andy García, Sheila Shah, Jacob Scipio and Levy Tran, with Iko Uwais playing the villain.</p>

On December 3, 2021, Tony Jaa confirmed filming had wrapped.</p>

<h3>Post-production</h3>

<h3>Critical response</h3>
<p>On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 14% of 123 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.5/10.The website's consensus reads: "Solid work from Jason Statham and some halfway decent set pieces aren't enough to make up for <i>Expend4bles</i>' lackluster action and cheap-looking effects." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 30 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest of the series, while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 64% overall positive score.</p>

<p>Owen Gleiberman, writing for <i>Variety</i>, said: "This is true 21st-century trash: a movie in which the action itself is expendable." Referencing the poor CGI effects, <i>Collider</i> wrote that <i>The Expendables 4</i> was "[o]ften resembling more of a mobile game than a movie"; several reviewers compared it to <i>Hidden Strike</i>, another film by Waugh with similarly bad CGI. Simon Thompson of IGN voiced similar complaints, stating: " the special effects, [...] look either unfinished or just so bad that it’s sad, [...] like they were ripped from the graphics package of a mid-to-low-budget video game from the early 2000s".</p>

<p>The acting, plot, dialogue, and violence were criticized by various reviewers. Thompson called the "clunky and uninspired dialogue" awful, concluding that the film was overall a "crushing disappointment that lacks any of the nostalgia, charisma, and charm that made the franchise appealing". Todd McCarthy of <i>Deadline</i> criticized that the movie was lazily executed, feeling that especially the final battle was an exact copy of <i>Meg 2</i>, another 2023 action film starring Statham.</p>

<p>Furthermore, multiple reviews criticized the overall weak cast in comparison to its predecessors, with many noting that the movie hardly retains the franchise's original selling point of featuring an all-star cast of action legends. A review in <i>Paste</i> noted that "Statham opts to accept a promotion to series lead" but added "Refashioning <i>The Expendables</i> into a Statham star vehicle only highlights the wrong kind of expendability from many of his long-time costars; why <i>can’t</i> we just watch our man kick ass on his own or in various duos?"</p> 

<p>An otherwise negative review at <i>Slashfilm</i> conceded however that the film might be the best of the franchise, while a review from <i>Digital Spy</i> stated while "the sense of cheesy throwback fun is restored in both the gleefully violent action and the script… It's absolutely not enough to save a movie that is two-thirds boring, but it does at least elevate <i>The Expendables 4</i> above the irredeemable third movie. You'll be left on such an adrenaline high that you wouldn't be surprised if – like the aforementioned STI – the Expendables will be back for another round." Popmatters felt Statham had the potential to become a strong lead in future entries, but conceded "it’s hard to see any of it in this risible, frequently exasperating, piece of sadism."</p>
