<h1>Men's underwear index</h1>

<div>Men's underwear index can indicate economic recovery after a slump.</div>
<p>The <b>men's underwear index</b> (<b>MUI</b>) is an economic index that can supposedly detect the beginnings of a recovery during an economic slump. The premise is that men's underwear are a necessity in normal economic times and sales remain stable.  During a severe downturn, demand for these goods changes as new purchases are deferred. Hence, men's purchasing habits for underwear (and that of their spouses on their behalf) is thought to be a good indicator of discretionary spending for consumption at large especially during turnaround periods.  </p>

<p>This indicator is noted for being followed by former Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan.</p>
