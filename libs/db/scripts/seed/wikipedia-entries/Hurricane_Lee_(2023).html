<p><b>Hurricane Lee</b> was a long-lived and very powerful Cape Verde hurricane that impacted Bermuda, the Northeastern United States, and Eastern Canada later in its lifetime. Lee was the thirteenth named storm, fourth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season. </p>

<p>Lee formed on September5 from a tropical wave that had moved offshore from West Africa into the tropical Atlantic a few days earlier. A strong steering current caused the storm to track northwestward, far from the Northern Leeward Islands. Highly favorable conditions enabled Lee to rapidly intensify to a Category 5 hurricane on September7, its winds increased by 85mph (140km/h) in 24hours. This made it the third‑fastest rapid intensification on record in the Atlantic, only behind Hurricane Wilma in 2005 and Hurricane Felix in 2007. Just as quickly however, Lee's strength waned, and it fluctuated in intensity for several days on account of strong wind shear and multiple eyewall replacement cycles. </p>

<p>On September13, the system rounded the southwest side of a large ridge of high pressure over the central Atlantic, turned, and accelerated northward. Lee soon entered into an environment of increasing wind shear and over increasingly cooler water, causing the system to slowly weaken as it was approaching Bermuda and New England, and to undergo the transition into an extratropical cyclone. The cyclone then made landfalls in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and in Newfoundland and Labrador, before moving out into the far northern Atlantic. As an extratropical low, Lee brought  rain and gale-force winds to parts of the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p>

<p>Swells generated by Lee caused dangerous surf and rip currents along the entire Atlantic coast of the United States. Strong winds with hurricane‑force gusts caused extensive power outages in the U.S. state of Maine, and in the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Three storm-related fatalities have been confirmed: a 15-year-oldboy drowned in Fernandina Beach, Florida; a 51-year-old man died in Searsport, Maine, when a tree fell onto the car he was in; and a 21-year-oldman who was killed when the boat he was in was capsized and sunk by a large wave in Manasquan Inlet, New Jersey.</p>

<p>The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to monitor a tropical wave over West Africa early on September1. The wave moved offshore into the tropical Atlantic Ocean on September2, producing disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity, and began to gradually organize. An area of low pressure formed from the wave two days later to the west-southwest of Cabo Verde. On September5, the low became more organized, with multiple low-level bands developing and the formation of a well-defined center. Consequently, advisories were initiated on Tropical Depression Thirteen at 15:00UTC that day. Amid favorable conditions for intensification, which included warm sea surface temperatures, moderate wind shear, and moderate mid-level relative humidity, the depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Lee within a few hours.</p>

<p>Lee tracked west-northwestward, steered by a mid-level ridge located to its north, and continued to intensify as it became better organized, with increased convective banding, development of a central dense overcast, and formation of a ragged eye, evident in visible satellite imagery by the following afternoon. By 21:00UTC on September6, the system strengthened into a Category1 hurricane while located far to the east of the Northern Leeward Islands. Explosive intensification began the next day, with Lee reaching Category2 strength at 15:00UTC, then reaching Category4 strength at 21:00UTC. A few hours later, a hurricane hunters mission into the storm found that it had reached Category5 strength, and possessed a clear 17mi-wide (28km) eye surrounded by convective cloud tops with temperatures as low as −105°F (−76°C). By 06:00UTC on September8, Lee's maximum sustained winds reached 165mph (270km/h), an increase of 85mph (140km/h) in 24hours, making it the third‑fastest intensifying Atlantic hurricane on record, behind only Felix in 2007 and Wilma in 2005. During this same time period, the hurricane's minimum barometric pressure fell to 926mbar (27.34inHg).</p>

<p>Several hours later, an increase of southwesterly wind shear caused Lee's eye to become cloud-filled and the storm to become more asymmetric. This caused Lee to quickly weaken to a low-end Category3 hurricane by early on September9. Later that day, data from a hurricane hunters mission into the storm revealed that Lee was undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle and still being adversely affected by modest vertical wind shear. The mission also observed were peak flight-level winds that were still decreasing, as a result of these findings, the hurricane was downgraded to Category2 at 03:00UTC on September10. Afterwards, as the system was completing its eyewall replacement cycle, the wind shear began to abate, which permitted the new, larger-diameter eye to contract and to grow more symmetric; as a result, Lee intensified to Category3 strength once again that same day with maximum sustained winds of 120mph (195km/h). Lee's overall appearance improved in the short term, and surface barometric pressure dropped due to the storm growing in size, despite maximum sustained winds remaining relatively consistent. The system underwent two eyewall replacement cycles over the course of the next couple days; and while they caused some fluctuations in its size and intensity, Lee remained a major hurricane throughout.</p>

<p>Lee slowly tracked west-northwestward to northwestward during this time, before turning northward on September13, moving around the western side of a subtropical ridge situated over the central Atlantic. That same day, the hurricane began to encounter increasing southwesterly shear coupled with dry air entrainment and weakened to Category2 strength. Despite this, Lee continued to grow in size, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 115mi (185km) from its center and tropical storm-force winds extending outward up to 240mi (390km). Slow weakening continued and Lee was downgraded to a  Category1 hurricane on the morning of September14, as its eye was no longer apparent in satellite images and deep convection was absent over the southwestern portions of the storm circulation. Later in the day, the system made a close, 185mi (300km), pass to the west of Bermuda. As Lee pushed northward, continued dry air entrainment and increasingly strong southerly wind shear displaced the storm's convection to the northern side of the system, weakening it further. These factors caused the hurricane to commence its extratropical transition, which was completed by 09:00UTC on September16. Later that day, the center of the cyclone made landfall on Long Island, in Nova Scotia. Then, overnight into September17, it traversed both New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, on its way towards Newfoundland. As an extratropical low, Lee began impacting Ireland and the United Kingdom on September20.</p>

<h3>Bermuda</h3>
<p>Bermuda received tropical storm watches on September12, which were later upgraded to warnings on September13.</p>

<p>Bermuda suffered tropical storm conditions. The House of Assembly moved their September15 meeting date to September22. L.F. Wade International Airport reported peak winds of 51 miles per hour (82km/h) and was closed until September16. Up to 11,342people lost power as a result of the storm; and the Devonshire and St. George's bus depots had significant power failures, causing them to be closed until September16. The Royal Naval Dockyard also suffered damage, causing ferry delays between the Dockyard and St. George's.</p>

<h3>United States</h3>
<p>A hurricane watch and a tropical storm watch were issued for the New England coastline from Rhode Island to Maine, including Block Island, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, on September13. A storm surge watch was also issued for Cape Cod Bay and Nantucket, although this alert was cancelled when the storm veered further to the east. During the afternoon on September 14, a boat was capsized during a small craft advisory after being hit by a tall wave in New Jersey's Manasquan Inlet, requiring first responders to rescue two people. A 21-year-oldman who was also on the boat was killed and his body washed ashore on Point Pleasant Beach on September24. Rough surf and dangerous rip currents were present along all of the east coast of the United States as Lee passed off the coast, and on September15, a 15-year-oldboy drowned due to rough surf off of Fernandina Beach, Florida. On September16, all Cape Air flights between Logan International Airport and Hancock County–Bar Harbor Airport were canceled.</p>

<h4>New York</h4>
<p>New York State Governor Kathy Hochul deployed fifty National Guard members to Long Island in preparation of the storm's arrival. The New York City Emergency Management Department advised coastal communities in the city to review their emergency plans. On September15, the town of Southampton declared a state of emergency, shutting down coastal roads. Eastern Long Island experienced beach erosion and gusty winds from the storm.</p>

<h4>Massachusetts</h4>
<p>In Massachusetts, boats on Nantucket were pulled from the water or were sheltered in protected harbors. All Hy-Line Cruises service was canceled between Martha's Vineyard and Hyannis, and from Martha's Vineyard to Nantucket. The Steamship Authority waived change and cancellation fees for ferries between September 15 and 17.  On September 14, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu announced the opening of an emergency operations center. Preparations to place sand bags and flood walls if necessary were also made. The Boston Police and Fire Departments were put on standby. On September15, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey announced a state of emergency in response to the cyclone. Healey also announced that 50members of the Massachusetts National Guard capable of operating high-water vehicles were being activated in anticipation of any potential rescues. Numerous flights were canceled or delayed at Logan International Airport, with some routes being canceled entirely due to high winds. The majority of damage was caused by trees being felled due to a combination of gusty winds and highly saturated ground. In Cohasset, a Cohasset police officer's cruiser was crushed by a falling tree while the officer was outside his cruiser.</p>

<h4>Rhode Island</h4>
<p>The Rhode Island Department of Transportation cleaned out storm drains and cut down at risk trees to mitigate flood and wind risk. Rhode Island Lieutenant Governor Sabina Matos reminded municipalities to update their hazard mitigation plans during a press conference with Governor Dan McKee and other state officials. McKee also announced that the <i>Independent Man</i> statue atop the Rhode Island State House in Providence was being taken down for repairs due to damage to the dome of the statue before any potential impacts by Lee could put it at risk.</p>

<h4>New Hampshire</h4>
<p>New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu announced that utility crews were being staged across the state to quickly respond to power outages and warned residents to not be complacent. A wind advisory was put into effect for New Hampshire's White Mountains, where wind would be stronger due to elevation. On Mount Washington, gusts reached up to 96mph (154km/h).</p>

<h4>Maine</h4>

The maximum of 6.5 inches (165mm) was recorded in Steuben, Maine.
<p>Maine Governor Janet Mills declared a state of emergency and requested President Joe Biden to issue an emergency disaster declaration for the state, and he did so later that evening. The state of emergency declaration also triggered Portland's minimum wage to be raised 1.5times from $14perhour to $21perhour. Utility workers from as far as Tennessee were brought into the state to help quickly restore power in case of outages and boat owners were advised to secure their boats by the Maine Harbor Master's Association. The White Mountains in Maine were also put under wind advisory. On September16, about half of all flights to and from Portland International Jetport were canceled, while most flights were canceled to and from Bangor International Airport due to high winds. The National Park Service also shut down certain areas of Acadia National Park.</p>

<p>On September16, wind damage occurred across southeastern portions of the state, where trees were down, including some that fell over a portion of SR 11 in Aroostook County, forcing a closure, and more than 92,000 power outages occurred. Maine House Republican leader Billy Bob Faulkingham, along with one other person, were rescued after their boat overturned off of Winter Harbor while they clung to the hull of the vessel until rescue arrived. One person was killed after his vehicle was struck by a falling tree in Searsport. An Ohio man was also injured while driving on SR11 in Moro Plantation after a downed tree went through his windshield. In Bar Harbor, a whale watching vessel broke free and crashed ashore, forcing authorities to offload 1,800 U.S. gallons (6,800L) of diesel fuel to prevent it from spilling into the ocean. As of the afternoon of September16, about 94,000customers in Maine were without power. Heavy rain also fell throughout Maine, peaking at 6.50in (165mm) in Steuben.</p>

<h3>Canada</h3> 
<p>Environment Canada issued hurricane watches for parts of Charlotte County, particularly its coast and Grand Manan Island in New Brunswick, as well as Nova Scotia's Digby, Yarmouth, Shelburne, and Queens counties. Further tropical storm watches were issued for southeastern New Brunswick as well as several parts of Nova Scotia. On September15, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that he had convened the Incident Response Group to discuss potential impacts from the cyclone and warned Canadians to take precautions and listen to their local officials.</p>

<p>Strong winds with hurricane‑force gusts caused widespread, but minimal damage in Nova Scotia and in New Brunswick as Lee passed through, mostly in the form of downed trees and power lines. Power outages associated with the cyclone rose to around 140,000 in Nova Scotia, and 37,000 in New Brunswick, on the afternoon of September16.</p>

<h4>New Brunswick</h4>
<p>Cancellations were made for cruise ships scheduled to stop at the Port of Saint John. On September15, New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization director Kyle Leavitt was joined by Premier Blaine Higgs and other officials in a press conference. Leavitt warned of hazardous driving conditions and urged residents to stay home, as well as advising them to complete any preparations by Friday. NB Power vice-president Nicole Poirier also announced that crews were put into position to respond to potential power outages. Many flights were canceled or delayed to and from Greater Moncton Roméo LeBlanc International Airport and Fredericton International Airport due to hazardous conditions on September16 and 17. The ferry service to and from Grand Manan was suspended and trees were felled throughout the province, sometimes taking utility poles and wires with them. Low-lying areas in Saint John and Fredericton suffered from flooding, and several historic trees were knocked over in Saint John.</p>
