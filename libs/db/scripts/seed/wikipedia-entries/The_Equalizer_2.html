<h2>Plot</h2>

<p>Robert McCall still lives in Boston, where he works as a driver for Lyft and assists the less fortunate with the help of his close friend and former DIA colleague Susan Plummer. McCall travels to Istanbul to retrieve the kidnapped 9-year-old daughter of bookstore owner, Grace Braelick. With the assistance of Susan, McCall gathers information for Sam Rubinstein, an elderly Holocaust survivor looking to recover a painting of his long-dead sister. After McCall returns home to find that his apartment's courtyard has been vandalized. He accepts an offer from Miles Whittaker, a troubled teen resident with artistic talent, to paint a mural on the walls. </p>

<p>Susan and DIA officer Dave York, McCall's former partner, are called to investigate the murder-suicide of an agency affiliate and his wife in Brussels. At their hotel, Susan is accosted in her room and killed during what seems to be a robbery. McCall determines that the expertly delivered fatal stab means that Susan was targeted and that the murder-suicide was also staged, informing York of his findings. During one of his Lyft runs, McCall is attacked by an assassin posing as a passenger. He kills the man and retrieves his mobile phone, discovering York's number on the phone's call list. </p>

<p>McCall confronts York at his home, and York confesses that after feeling used and discarded by the government he became a mercenary and that he killed Susan when she would have figured out that he was behind the Brussels killings. McCall leaves the house where York's current teammates Kovac, Ari and Resnik are waiting. Before departing, he promises to kill the entire team as revenge for the death of Susan. Resnik and Ari head to Susan's house to kill her husband Brian, but McCall helps him escape. York and Kovac break into McCall's apartment, where Miles is painting the walls. Monitoring the apartment via webcams, McCall directs Miles to safety in a hidden safe room, and makes a call to York luring him away. Miles emerges from hiding, but finds York and Kovac still waiting outside the apartment to take him hostage. </p>

<p>York deduces that McCall has gone to his seaside hometown, which has been evacuated as a hurricane approaches. Kovac, Ari and Resnik start searching the town in the wind while York situates himself atop the town's watchtower. McCall stealthily dispatches the team one by one, killing Kovac with a speargun, slashing Ari to death, and setting an explosive trap that kills Resnik. York reveals that he has Miles bound in the trunk of his car, and shoots at it in an attempt to lure McCall out. McCall confronts York atop the tower, and their fight ends with McCall stabbing York in the chest with his own knife the same way York did to Susan, followed by a stab in York's nape, and then pushing York off the tower. McCall rescues Miles, and the two retreat into McCall's home to bind their wounds and wait out the hurricane.</p>

<p>Back in Boston, Susan's information about Sam's painting helps McCall reunite Sam with his long-lost sister. Miles finishes painting the mural on the apartment complex's brick wall, returns to school, and focuses on his art. McCall's neighbor Fatima notices Miles' new mural and studies it with a smile. Having moved back into his old house, McCall looks out towards the calm sea.</p>
