<h1><i>Indiana Jones</i></h1>

<div>American film franchise</div>
<div>This article is about the franchise. For the character, see Indiana Jones (character). For other uses, see Indiana Jones (disambiguation).</div>


<p><i><b>Indiana Jones</b></i> is an American media franchise consisting of five films and a prequel television series, along with games, comics, and tie-in novels, that depicts the adventures of Dr. Henry Walton "Indiana" Jones, Jr. (portrayed in all films by Harrison Ford), a fictional professor of archaeology. </p>
 
<p>The series began in 1981 with the film <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>. In 1984, a prequel, <i>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</i>, was released, and in 1989, a sequel, <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i>. A fourth film followed in 2008, titled <i>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</i>. A fifth and final film, titled <i>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</i>, was theatrically released on June 30, 2023. The series was created by George Lucas. The first four films were directed by Steven Spielberg, who worked closely with Lucas during their production, while the fifth film was directed by James Mangold. In 1992, the franchise expanded to a television series with <i>The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</i>, exploring the character in his childhood and youth, and including adventures with his parents.</p>

<p>Marvel Comics began publishing <i>The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones</i> in 1983, and Dark Horse Comics gained the comic book rights to the character in 1991. Novelizations of the films have been published, as well as many novels with original adventures, including a series of German novels by Wolfgang Hohlbein, twelve novels set before the films published by Bantam Books, and a series set during the character's childhood inspired by the television show. Numerous <i>Indiana Jones</i> video games have been released since 1982. </p>



<h2>Background</h2>
<p>During 1973, George Lucas wrote <i>The Adventures of Indiana Smith</i>. Like <i>Star Wars</i>, it was an opportunity to create a modern version of the movie serials of the 1930s and 1940s. Lucas discussed the concept with Philip Kaufman, who worked with him for several weeks and decided upon the Ark of the Covenant as the MacGuffin. The project was stalled when Clint Eastwood hired Kaufman to write <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales</i>. In May 1977, Lucas was in Maui, trying to escape the worldwide success of <i>Star Wars</i>. His friend and colleague Steven Spielberg was also there, on vacation from work on <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>. Spielberg told Lucas he was interested in making a James Bond film, but Lucas pitched him of an idea "better than James Bond", outlining the plot of <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>. Spielberg loved it, calling it "a James Bond film without the hardware", and had the character's surname changed to Jones. Spielberg and Lucas made a deal with Paramount Pictures for five Indiana Jones films.</p>

<p>Spielberg and Lucas aimed to make <i>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</i> much darker, because of their personal moods following their respective breakups and divorces. Lucas made the film a prequel because he did not want the Nazis to be the villains again. He had ideas regarding the Monkey King and a haunted castle, but eventually created the Sankara Stones, that would be used in the film. He hired Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz to write the script; he knew of their interest in Indian culture. The major scenes that were dropped from <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> were included in this film: an escape using a giant rolling gong as a shield, a fall out of a plane in a raft, and a mine cart chase. For the third film, Spielberg revisited the Monkey King and haunted castle concepts, before Lucas suggested the Holy Grail. Spielberg had previously rejected this as too ethereal, but then devised a father-son story and decided that "The Grail that everybody seeks could be a metaphor for a son seeking reconciliation with a father and a father seeking reconciliation with a son."</p>

<p>Following the 1989 release of <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i>, Lucas let the series end as he felt he could not think of a good plot device to drive the next installment and chose instead to produce <i>The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</i>, which explored the character in his early years. Ford played Indiana in one episode, narrating his adventures in 1920 Chicago. When Lucas shot Ford's role in December 1992, he realized that the scene opened up the possibility of a film with an older Indiana set in the 1950s. The film could reflect a science fiction 1950s B-movie, with aliens as the plot device. Ford disliked the new angle, telling Lucas: "No way am I being in a Steven Spielberg movie like that." Spielberg himself, who depicted aliens in <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i> and <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i>, resisted it. Lucas devised a story, which Jeb Stuart turned into a script from October 1993 to May 1994. Lucas wanted Indiana to get married, which would allow Henry Jones Sr. to return, expressing concern over whether his son is happy with what he has accomplished. After learning that Joseph Stalin was interested in psychic warfare, Lucas decided to have Russians as the villains and the aliens to have psychic powers. Following Stuart's next draft, Lucas hired <i>Last Crusade</i> writer Jeffrey Boam to write the next three versions, the last of which was completed in March 1996. Three months later, <i>Independence Day</i> was released, and Spielberg told Lucas he would not make another alien invasion film (or at least not until <i>War of the Worlds</i> in 2005). Lucas decided to focus on the <i>Star Wars</i> prequels instead.</p>

<p>In 2000, Spielberg's son asked when the next <i>Indiana Jones</i> film would be released, which made him interested in reviving the project. The same year, Ford, Lucas, Spielberg, Frank Marshall, and Kathleen Kennedy met during the American Film Institute's tribute to Ford, and decided they wanted to enjoy the experience of making an <i>Indiana Jones</i> film again. Spielberg also found returning to the series a respite from his many dark films during this period. Spielberg and Lucas discussed the central idea of a B-movie involving aliens, and Lucas suggested using crystal skulls to ground the idea. Lucas found these artifacts as fascinating as the Ark, and had intended to feature them for a <i>Young Indiana Jones</i> episode before the show's cancellation. M. Night Shyamalan was hired to write for an intended 2002 shoot, but he was overwhelmed by the task, and claimed it was difficult to get Ford, Spielberg, and Lucas to focus. Stephen Gaghan and Tom Stoppard were also approached.</p>

<p>Frank Darabont, who wrote various <i>Young Indiana Jones</i> episodes, was hired to write in May 2002. His script, titled <i>Indiana Jones and the City of Gods</i>, was set in the 1950s, with ex-Nazis pursuing Jones. Spielberg conceived the idea because of real-life figures such as Juan Perón in Argentina, who allegedly protected Nazi war criminals. Darabont claimed Spielberg loved the script, but Lucas had issues with it, and decided to take over writing himself. Lucas and Spielberg acknowledged that the 1950s setting could not ignore the Cold War, and the Russians were more plausible villains. Spielberg decided he could not satirize the Nazis after directing <i>Schindler's List</i>, while Ford felt "We plum[b] wore the Nazis out." Darabont's main contribution was reintroducing Marion Ravenwood as Indiana's love interest, but he gave them a 13-year-old daughter, which Spielberg decided was too similar to <i>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</i>.</p>

<p>Jeff Nathanson met with Spielberg and Lucas in August 2004, and turned in the next drafts in October and November 2005, titled <i>The Atomic Ants</i>. David Koepp continued on from there, giving his script the subtitle <i>Destroyer of Worlds</i>, based on the J. Robert Oppenheimer quote. It was changed to <i>Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</i>, as Spielberg found this a more inviting title which actually named the plot device. Koepp wanted to depict the character of Mutt as a nerd, but Lucas refused, explaining he had to resemble Marlon Brando in <i>The Wild One</i>; "he needs to be what Indiana Jones's father thought of [him]– the curse returns in the form of his own son– he's everything a father can't stand". Koepp collaborated with Lawrence Kasdan on the film's "love dialogue".</p>

<p>Development of the fifth film began in 2008, but the project stalled for years. In 2012, The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm, the series' production company, thereby becoming the owner of the <i>Indiana Jones</i> intellectual property. The following year, Walt Disney Studios acquired the distribution and marketing rights to future <i>Indiana Jones</i> films, with Paramount retaining the distribution rights to the first four films and receiving "financial participation" from any additional films. Development on the film continued, eventually forming into <i>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</i>. The film was directed by James Mangold, who co-wrote the script with Jez and John-Henry Butterworth. Spielberg was initially set to direct the film, before passing it to Mangold. Spielberg instead served as an executive producer with Lucas, along with producers Kennedy and Marshall. Ford reprised the title role, along with Karen Allen and John Rhys-Davies and new cast members included Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Kretschmann, Boyd Holbrook, Shaunette Renée Wilson, Toby Jones and Antonio Banderas. The film was co-produced by Lucasfilm and Walt Disney Pictures, marking the first film in the series with Disney's involvement. Filming eventually began in the United Kingdom in June 2021 and wrapped in February 2022. It is intended to be Ford's last time playing the title character and is stated to be the last film in the franchise overall. <i>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</i> was released by Disney on June 30, 2023.</p>

<h3><i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> (1981)</h3>
<div>Main article: Raiders of the Lost Ark</div>
<p>The first film is set in 1936. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is hired by government agents to locate the Ark of the Covenant, the gold plated chest containing the stone tablets Moses used to inscribe the Ten Commandments before the Nazi Germans steal it for themselves. The Nazis have teams searching for religious artifacts, including the Ark, which is rumored to make an army that carries the Ark before it invincible. The Nazis are being helped by Indiana's arch-rival and French archaeologist René Belloq (Paul Freeman). With the help of his former lover and tough bar owner Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and his excavator friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), Indiana manages to recover the Ark in Egypt. The Nazis steal the Ark and capture Indiana and Marion. Belloq and the Nazis perform a ceremony to open the Ark, but when they do so, all they find inside is sand. Suddenly, spirits come out of the Ark and the Nazis are all killed by the Ark's wrath. Indiana and Marion, who survived by closing their eyes, manage to get the Ark to the United States, where it is stored in a secret government warehouse.</p>

<h3><i>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</i> (1984)</h3>
<div>Main article: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</div>
<p>The second film is a prequel set in 1935, a year before <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>. Indiana escapes Chinese gangsters led by Lao Che with the help of singer/actress Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and his twelve-year-old sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan). The trio crash-land in India, where they come across a Punjabi village whose children have been kidnapped. The Thuggee cult led by Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) has also taken the holy Sankara Stones, which they will use to take over the world. Indiana manages to overcome Mola Ram's evil power, rescues the children and returns the stones to their rightful place, overcoming his own mercenary nature. The film has been noted as an outlier in the franchise, as it does not feature Indy's university or any antagonistic political entity, and is less focused on archaeology, being presented as a dark movie with gross-out elements, human sacrifice and torture.</p>

<h3><i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i> (1989)</h3>
<div>Main article: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</div>
<p>The third film is set in 1938. Indiana and his friend Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) are assigned by American businessman Walter Donovan (Julian Glover) to find the Holy Grail. They are teamed up with Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), following on from where Indiana's estranged father Henry (Sean Connery) left off before he disappeared. It transpires that Donovan and Elsa are in league with the Nazis, who captured Henry Jones to get Indiana to help them find the Grail. However, Indiana recovers his father's diary filled with his research, and manages to rescue him before finding the location of the Grail. Both Donovan and Elsa fall to the temptation of the Grail, while Indiana and Henry realize that their relationship with each other is more important than finding the relic.</p>

<h3><i>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</i> (2008)</h3>
<div>Main article: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</div>
<p>The fourth film is set in 1957, nineteen years after <i>The Last Crusade</i>. Indiana is having a quiet life teaching before being thrust into a new adventure. He races against agents of the Soviet Union, led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) for a crystal skull. His journey takes him across Nevada, Connecticut, Peru, and the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. Faced with betrayal by one of his best friends, Mac (Ray Winstone), Indiana is introduced to a greaser named Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), who turns out to be his son (his real name revealed to be Henry Jones III), and is reunited with, and eventually marries, Marion Ravenwood, who was the lead female character introduced in the first movie.</p>

<h3><i>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</i> (2023)</h3>
<div>Main article: Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</div>
<p>The fifth and concluding film is set in 1969, twelve years after <i>The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.</i> Indiana has moved to New York City, teaching at Hunter College with plans to retire, after his marriage with Marion collapsed following Mutt's death in the Vietnam War. Once his estranged goddaughter Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) arrives asking for Archimedes' Dial, a relic Jones and her father Basil (Toby Jones) retrieved from the Nazis in 1944 during the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II, a Nazi-turned-NASA scientist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) starts pursuing Jones, wanting to exploit the Dial's unusual properties to change the outcome of World War II. Indiana's journey takes him to Morocco, Greece, and Italy, where he inadvertently ends up traveling back in time to the 212 BC Siege of Syracuse after Voller uses the Dial to locate a time fissure in hopes of assassinating Adolf Hitler prior to the Invasion of Poland to usurp him and lead the Nazis to victory. Upon returning to New York in the present time, Indiana reconciles with Marion.</p>

<p>A television series titled <i>The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</i> (1992–1996) featured three incarnations of the character: Sean Patrick Flanery played Indiana aged 16–21; Corey Carrier played an 8- to 10-year-old version in several episodes; and George Hall narrated the show as the 93-year-old Jones, who bookended each episode. Lucas began developing the series in 1990 as "edutainment" that would be more cerebral than the films. The show was his first collaboration with producer Rick McCallum, and he wrote the stories for each episode. Writers and directors on the show included Carrie Fisher, Frank Darabont, Vic Armstrong, Ben Burtt, Terry Jones, Nicolas Roeg, Mike Newell and Joe Johnston. In the <i>Chronicles</i>, Jones crosses paths with many historical figures, played by stars such as Daniel Craig, Christopher Lee, Bob Peck, Jeffrey Wright, Marc Warren, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Elizabeth Hurley, Anne Heche, Vanessa Redgrave, Julian Fellowes, Timothy Spall and Harrison Ford as a 50-year-old Indiana in one episode (taking the usual place of Hall).</p>

<p>The show was filmed in over 25 countries for over 150 weeks. Season one was shot from March 1991 to March 1992; the second season began two months later and wrapped in April 1993. The ABC network was unsure of Lucas's cerebral approach, and attempted to advertise the series as an action-adventure like the films. Ratings were good if unspectacular, and ABC was nervous enough to put the show on hiatus after six episodes until September 1992. With only four episodes left of the second season to air, ABC eventually sold the show to the Family Channel, who changed the format from 50-minute episodes to 90-minute TV movies. Filming for the final four episodes took place from January 1994 to May 1996. <i>The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</i> received a mixed reception from fans, although it won 10 Emmy Awards out of 23 nominations, as well as a 1994 Golden Globe nomination for Best Drama series. It was also an experimentation ground in digital effects for Lucasfilm.</p>

<p>The original broadcast versions of some episodes were briefly released in Japan on laserdisc in 1993 and on VHS in 1994. However, Lucas re-edited and restructured the show for its worldwide home video release. Major structural changes were made, including the complete removal of the 'bookend' sections narrated by the 93-year-old Jones. The editing combined episodes together into creating roughly an hour and a half movies to streamline the series into a more consistent structure. Approximately half of the series was released on VHS in various markets around the world in 1999, but the entire series was not released until its DVD debut, in a series of three boxsets released from 2007 to 2008, to tie in with the theatrical debut of <i>Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</i>. Among other extras, the DVDs include approximately 100 new historical featurettes.</p>

<h3>Proposed Disney+ series</h3>
<p>In November 2022, it was reported that Lucasfilm was developing an <i>Indiana Jones</i> series for Disney+. The series was set to be a prequel to <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> and would have been the second prequel series following <i>The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</i>. However, by March 2023, Lucasfilm was reported to have canceled the planned prequel series to focus on the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise, this being similarly cited as the reason behind the cancellation of the fellow non-<i>Star Wars</i> Lucasfilm show <i>Willow</i>. On May 11, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy expressed interest in continuing the <i>Indiana Jones</i> franchise through a television series centering on characters aside from Jones, due to Harrison Ford retiring from the role after <i>Dial of Destiny</i>.</p>

<h2>Other media</h2>
<h3>Novels</h3>
<p>A novelization of <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> was written by Campbell Black and published by Ballantine Books in April 1981. It was followed by <i>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</i>, written by James Kahn and published by Ballantine in May 1984. Finally, <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i> was published in May 1989, and was the first <i>Indiana Jones</i> novel by Rob MacGregor. A fan of the first two films, MacGregor admitted that writing the novelization made him "somewhat disappointed" with the third film, as he had expanded the script whereas Steven Spielberg had cut scenes to tighten the story.</p>

<p>George Lucas asked MacGregor to continue writing original novels for Bantam Books. These were geared toward an adult or young adult audience, and were prequels set in the 1920s or early 1930s after Jones graduates from college. Of the film characters, Lucas only permitted Marcus Brody to appear. He asked MacGregor to base the books on real myths, but except for the deletion of a sex scene, the writer was given total creative freedom. His six books – <i>Indiana Jones and the Peril at Delphi</i>, <i>Indiana Jones and the Dance of the Giants</i>, <i>Indiana Jones and the Seven Veils</i>, <i>Indiana Jones and the Genesis Deluge</i>, <i>Indiana Jones and the Unicorn's Legacy</i>, and <i>Indiana Jones and the Interior World</i> – were published from February 1991 to November 1992. <i>The Genesis Deluge</i>, published in February 1992 and featuring Noah's Ark, was the bestselling novel; MacGregor felt this was because it "had a strong following among religious-oriented people [...] because they tend to take the Noah's Ark story to heart and think of it as history and archaeological fact, rather than myth." MacGregor's favorite book was <i>The Seven Veils</i>, which featured real-life explorer Percy Fawcett and the death of Indiana's wife, Deirdre Campbell.</p>

<p>Martin Caidin wrote the next two novels in Bantam's series, <i>Indiana Jones and the Sky Pirates</i> and <i>Indiana Jones and the White Witch</i>. These feature Gale Parker as Indiana's sidekick; they introduced afterwords to the series, regarding each novel's historical context.</p>

<p>Caidin became ill, so Max McCoy took over in 1995 and wrote the final four novels: <i>Indiana Jones and the Philosopher's Stone</i>, <i>Indiana Jones and the Dinosaur Eggs</i>, <i>Indiana Jones and the Hollow Earth</i>, and <i>Indiana Jones and the Secret of the Sphinx</i>. McCoy set his books closer in time to the events of <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>, which led to his characterizing Indiana as "a bit darker". The prologue of his first book featured a crystal skull, and this became a recurring story, concluding when Jones gives it up in the final novel. Lucas's involvement with McCoy's novels was limited, although Lucasfilm censored sexual or outlandish elements to make the books appeal to younger readers; they also rejected the theme of time travel in the final book. Sallah, Lao Che, Rene Belloq and the Nazis made appearances, and McCoy also pitted Jones against Benito Mussolini's fascists and the Japanese. Jones also has a doomed romance with Alecia Dunstin, a librarian at the British Museum. A novel involving the Spear of Destiny was dropped, because Dark Horse Comics was developing the idea.</p>

<p>The books were only published in paperback, as the series editor felt readers would not be prepared to pay the hardback price for an adventure novel.</p>

<p>In February 2008, the novelizations of the first three films were published in one edition; James Rollins' <i>Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</i> novelization arrived the following May. Children's novelizations of all four films were published by Scholastic in 2008.</p>

<p>MacGregor was said to be writing new books for Ballantine for early 2009, but none have been published.</p>

<p>A new adult adventure, <i>Indiana Jones and the Army of the Dead</i> by Steve Perry, was released in September 2009.</p>

<p>A novel based on the video game <i>Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings</i>, written by MacGregor to coincide with the release of the game, was canceled due to problems around the game's production.</p>

<p>Additionally, German author Wolfgang Hohlbein wrote eight <i>Indiana Jones</i> novels in the early 1990s, which were never translated to English.</p>

<h3>Comic books</h3>
<div>Main article: Indiana Jones (comics)</div>
<p>Indiana Jones has appeared in numerous comic books, from two different publishers. Marvel Comics initially held the comic book licensing rights, leading to adaptations of the films <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>, <i>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</i>, and <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i>. Following the <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> adaptation, Marvel published <i>The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones</i> from 1983 to 1986. This ongoing monthly series ran for thirty-four issues and featured the character's first original adventures in comic book form.</p>

<p>After Marvel's licensing of the character ended, Dark Horse Comics acquired publishing rights and adapted the <i>Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</i> video game. From 1992 to 1996, following the <i>Fate of Atlantis</i> adaptation, Dark Horse published seven limited series, as well comics based on <i>The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</i> television series. In 2004, Indiana Jones appeared in the non-canon story, "Into the Great Unknown", first published in <i>Star Wars Tales</i> #19. The story sees Indiana Jones and Short Round discover a crashed <i>Millennium Falcon</i> in the Pacific Northwest, along with Han Solo's skeleton and the realization that a rumored nearby Sasquatch is in fact Chewbacca. With the franchise's revival in 2008, Dark Horse published an adaptation of <i>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</i>. Dark Horse followed this with <i>Indiana Jones Adventures</i>, a short-lived series of digest-sized comics aimed at children. An additional limited series, titled <i>Indiana Jones and the Tomb of the Gods</i>, was also published from 2008 to 2009.</p>

<h3>Toy lines</h3>
<div>Further information: LEGO Indiana Jones</div>
<p>For the holiday season following the June 1981 debut of <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>, Kenner produced a 12-inch-tall "Authentically styled Action Figure" of Indiana Jones. The next spring they delivered nine smaller-scale (33⁄4") action figures, three playsets, replicas of the German desert convoy truck and Jones's horse, all derived from the <i>Raiders</i> movie. They also offered a <i>Raiders</i> board game.</p>

<p>In conjunction with the theatrical release of <i>The Temple of Doom</i> in 1984, TSR, Inc. released miniature metal versions of twelve characters from both films for a role playing game. LJN Toys Ltd. also released action figures of Jones, Mola Ram, and the Giant Thugee.</p>

<p>No toys were produced to tie in with <i>The Last Crusade</i> in 1989</p>

<p>Hasbro released toys based on <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> and <i>Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</i> in 2008. Further figures, including characters from <i>The Temple of Doom</i> and <i>The Last Crusade</i>, followed later in the year, but were distributed on a very limited basis. This line of toys included 33⁄4-inch and 12-inch figures, vehicles, a playset, and a series of "Adventure Heroes" aimed at young children. Hasbro announced the cancellation of the line in the fall of 2008, due to decreasing sales, although some figures continued to be released up until the 2011 San Diego Comic Convention.</p>

<p>Sideshow Collectibles, Gentle Giant, Diamond Select Toys and Kotobukiya also earned Indiana Jones licensing rights in 2008. Lego released eight play sets to coincide with the fourth film, based on <i>Raiders</i> and <i>The Last Crusade</i> as well as on <i>Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</i></p>

<p>Merchandise featuring franchise cross-overs include a Mr. Potato Head "Taters Of The Lost Ark" set by Hasbro, Mickey Mouse as Indiana Jones, and a Muppets-branded Adventure Kermit action figure, produced by Palisades Toys and based on the frog's appearance in the Disney World stunt show as seen in <i>The Muppets at Walt Disney World</i>.</p>

<p>Disney Vinylmation introduced a series based on <i>Indiana Jones</i> characters in 2014.</p>

<p>Hasbro also made the “Adventure Series” line in 2023 to go alongside the release of <i>Dial of Destiny</i>. This line included figures from the original trilogy as well as the new film.</p>

<h3>Role-playing games</h3>
<p>There have been two publications of role-playing games based on the Indiana Jones franchise. <i>The Adventures of Indiana Jones Role-Playing Game</i> was designed and published by TSR, Inc. under license in 1984. Ten years later, West End Games acquired the rights to publish their own version, <i>The World of Indiana Jones</i>.</p>
