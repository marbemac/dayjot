<p><b>Abdul Karim Telgi</b> (born 29 July 1961 – 23 October 2017) was a convicted Indian counterfeiter. He earned money by printing counterfeit stamp paper in India.</p>



<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Telgi's mother was Shariefabee Ladsaab Telgi, and his father was an employee of Indian Railways. His father died while he was young. Telgi paid for his education at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya Khanapur, an English medium school, by selling fruits and vegetables on trains. Eventually, he moved to  Gulf, Saudi Arabia. Seven years later, he returned to India, when he began a counterfeiting career, originally focusing on fake passports. He started a business to export manpower to Saudi Arabia and opened a company, Arabian Metro Travels at  New Marine Lines. He used to create several fake documents that would facilitate laborers' smooth passage at the airport even if their passport had an ECR (emigration check required) stamp or other issues that could raise red flags for immigration officials. This practice was called "pushing" in the parlance of manpower exporters.</p>



<h2>Counterfeiting charges</h2>
<p>Telgi moved to more complex counterfeiting when he began to counterfeit stamp paper. He appointed 300 people as agents who sold the fakes to bulk purchasers, including banks, insurance companies, and stock brokerage firms. The size of the scam was estimated to be around ₹300 billion (US$3.8billion)  One aspect of the scandal that caused much concern was that it required the involvement of many police officers and other government employees including Nikhil Kothari, an Assistant Police Investigator who was found to have a net worth of over ₹1 billion (US$13million), despite making a salary of only ₹9,000 (US$110) per month. Several police officers were implicated in the case. Pradip Sawant, then Deputy Commissioner of Police, Special Branch, Mumbai, was discharged but subsequently reinstated after being found innocent. Then police officer S M Mushrif, known for the book <i>Who killed Karkare</i> took decisive measures in this case.</p>

<p>On 17 January 2006, Telgi and several associates were sentenced to 30 years rigorous imprisonment. On 28 June 2007, Telgi was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 13 years for another aspect of the scandal. He was also fined ₹10 billion (US$130million). The Income Tax Department requested that Telgi's property be confiscated to pay the fine. He had been in jail for 13 years.</p>



<h2>Death</h2>
<p>Telgi was suffering from meningitis and died on 23 October 2017 at Victoria Hospital, Bengaluru. He was suffering from diabetes and hypertension for over 20 years, besides other ailments.</p>
