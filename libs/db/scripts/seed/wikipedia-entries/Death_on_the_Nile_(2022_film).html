<p>In World War I, a young Hercule Poirot devises a strategy to advance his Belgian infantry company. While his strategy is initially successful, a booby trap kills and injures many in the company as well as mutilating Poirot's face. His fiancée, nurse Katherine, does not recoil, but suggests he could grow a mustache to hide his scars.</p>

<p>In 1937 at a London club, Poirot watches as blues singer Salome Otterbourne performs. He notices Jacqueline "Jackie" de Bellefort introducing her fiancé Simon Doyle to her childhood friend, heiress Linnet Ridgeway. After meeting Simon, Linnet agrees to hire him as her land agent.</p>

<p>Six weeks later, Poirot encounters his friend Bouc and his mother, Euphemia, in Egypt, where Bouc invites Poirot to join them at the hotel to celebrate the wedding of Linnet and Simon. Others join their honeymoon trip: Linnet's maid, Louise Bourget; Salome and her niece/manager, Rosalie, Linnet's schoolfriend; Linnet's godmother, Marie Van Schuyler with her nurse, Mrs. Bowers; Linnet's financial manager and cousin, Andrew Katchadourian; and Dr. Linus Windlesham, Linnet's former fiancé who renounced his wealthy background. Linnet asks Poirot for protection from the obsessive and bitter Jackie, who has stalked the couple to Egypt.</p>

<p>To escape Jackie, the group boards the cruise ship S.S. <i>Karnak,</i> but Linnet tells Poirot she distrusts her guests. During an excursion to Abu Simbel, Bouc reveals he is dating Rosalie, despite his mother's disapproval; Poirot finds himself attracted to Salome. After a boulder falls off a column and nearly crushes Linnet and Simon, the guests return to the <i>Karnak</i> to discover Jackie has boarded. Poirot, affected by champagne, confides to Jackie that he renounced romance after Katherine died in a mortar explosion. Linnet goes to bed and Simon confronts Jackie, who shoots him in the leg. When she attempts to shoot herself, Rosalie and Bouc intervene. They take Jackie to Mrs. Bowers, while Windlesham arrives to treat Simon. The following morning, Louise discovers Linnet has been fatally shot in the head. Linnet's valuable necklace has also been stolen.</p>

<p>Poirot, assisted by Simon and Bouc, interrogates the guests, each of whom bears a grudge against Linnet or would benefit from her death:</p>
<ul><li>Louise's engagement was ended by Linnet, who distrusted Louise's fiancé.</li>
<li>Windlesham was engaged to Linnet until she left him for Simon.</li>
<li>Andrew was embezzling from Linnet.</li>
<li>Bowers' formerly wealthy family was ruined by Linnet's father during the Great Depression.</li>
<li>Van Schuyler is a beneficiary of Linnet's will. She and Bowers are lovers.</li>
<li>Salome and Rosalie were the targets of Linnet's racist remarks, years ago.</li>
<li>Euphemia finds Linnet's necklace. Poirot suspects she resented Linnet for introducing Bouc to Rosalie.</li></ul>
<p>Jackie was monitored by Bowers all night. Her gun is dredged from the Nile, wrapped in Van Schuyler's missing scarf and a bloody handkerchief.</p>

<p>Poirot reveals that Euphemia hired him to investigate Rosalie, who, he concludes, is more than worthy of her son's affection. Rosalie, angry at being investigated, storms off and discovers Louise's body with money, so Poirot suspects that she witnessed Linnet's murder and blackmailed the killer. He sees a possible witness' outline in the blood spatter. Interrogating Bouc with Simon, Poirot deduces that Bouc found Linnet dead and stole her necklace to gain financial freedom from his mother, but panicked and put it in Euphemia's belongings. Bouc witnessed Louise's murder, but before revealing the killer, he is shot through the throat and is killed; Poirot chases the killer, but only finds the abandoned gun.</p>

<p>Locking the surviving guests in the boat's saloon, Poirot reveals that Simon killed Linnet, with Jackie as the mastermind. They are still lovers and arranged Simon's romance with Linnet to inherit her wealth. Simon drugged Poirot's champagne and Jackie pretended to shoot a blank at Simon who faked his injury with paint stolen from Euphemia. While Jackie distracted Bouc and Rosalie, Simon killed Linnet and, returning to the saloon, shot his own leg, muffled by Van Schuyler's scarf. Jackie killed Louise with Windlesham's scalpel, and Bouc with Andrew's gun. As a final clue, Poirot reveals the handkerchief that had been faded to pink used in the fake shooting, recovered along with the gun. Faced with Poirot's irrefutable proof, Jackie embraces Simon and shoots him through the back, killing them both with one shot. As the passengers disembark, Poirot is unable to voice his feelings to Salome.</p>

<p>Six months later, Poirot is now clean-shaven and visits Salome's club to watch her rehearse.</p>

<h3>Critical response</h3>
<p>On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 61% of 288 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10.The website's consensus reads: "Old-fashioned to a fault, the solidly entertaining <i>Death on the Nile</i> is enlivened by its all-star cast and director-star Kenneth Branagh's obvious affection for the material." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 52 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, the same as its predecessor, while those at PostTrak gave it a 77% positive score, with 57% saying they would definitely recommend it.</p>

<p>David Rooney of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> wrote: "For some of us who look back with affection on John Guillermin's lush 1978 screen version, there's a nagging feeling throughout that Branagh, while hitting the marks of storytelling and design, has drained some of the fun out of it." Owen Gleiberman of <i>Variety</i> called the film "a moderately diverting dessert that carries you right along. It never transcends the feeling that you're seeing a relic injected with life serum, but that, in a way, is part of its minor-league charm." Edward Porter of <i>The Times</i> gave the film three out of five stars, saying that its "gaudy style — combined with the melodrama of the script's modified take on Christie's plot — remains diverting even if some of the supposedly Egyptian backdrops look phoney." Sandra Hall of <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> gave the film four out of five stars, writing: "While the gamble Branagh takes in disinterring Poirot's long-neglected sensitive side may be regarded as sacrilege by some, I think it works. Poirot has a yearning heart."</p>

<p>Wendy Ide of <i>The Observer</i> gave the film two out of five stars, writing: "The camera whirls giddily, dizzy from the sparkle and spectacle, but not quite able to conceal the fact that this is an empty bauble of a movie." David Fear of <i>Rolling Stone</i> wrote that the film "has its joys and flaws apart from that Armie factor, but it's almost like trying to assess whether the appetizer course could have been slightly undercooked while an elephant stampedes over the whole dinner table." Joe Morgenstern of <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> wrote that the film "has pizazz and period style in the same way today's big-brand toothpastes have flavor – artificial ingredients give them a taste that's discernible, but too generic to name."</p>

<h3>Accolades</h3>
<p>The film was nominated for Best Action / Adventure Film at the 47th Saturn Awards but lost to <i>Top Gun: Maverick</i>. It also received a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Photoreal Feature at the 21st Visual Effects Society Awards.</p>



<h2>Sequel</h2>
<div>Main article: A Haunting in Venice</div>
<p>In a December 2017 interview with the Associated Press, Branagh discussed developing the adaptation of <i>Death on the Nile</i> with the possibility of more films to follow, potentially creating a new "cinematic universe" of Christie films:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I think there are possibilities, aren't there? With 66books and short stories and plays, she — and she often brings people together in her own books actually, so innately — she enjoyed that," he says. "You feel as though there is a world — just like with Dickens, there's a complete world that she's created — certain kinds of characters who live in her world — that I think has real possibilities."</p></blockquote>

<p>In February 2022, Branagh stated that discussions for additional films were ongoing.

By March of the same year, 20th Century Studios President Steve Asbell confirmed that a third movie was in development. Branagh returned as director and star, while Michael Green once again served as screenwriter. The third film was set in "post-war Venice", an adaptation "of one of the lesser-known novels".
