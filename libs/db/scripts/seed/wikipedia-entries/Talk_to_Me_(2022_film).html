<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>At a crowded house party, Cole searches for his brother Duckett. When Cole finds Duckett and attempts to bring him home, Duckett stabs his brother before fatally stabbing himself in the face.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, 17-year-old Mia is struggling with the second anniversary of her mother Rhea's death by overdose and her distant relationship with her father Max. Driving at night, she comes across a fatally injured kangaroo, but cannot bring herself to put it out of its misery. Mia, her best friend Jade, and Jade's little brother Riley sneak out to one of many gatherings hosted by Hayley and Joss, where the main attraction is a severed, embalmed hand of mysterious origin. Holding the hand and saying "Talk to me" allows a person to communicate with a spirit, followed by saying "I let you in", enabling the spirit to possess them. The connection must be severed before ninety seconds in order to prevent the spirits from binding themselves to that person. Mia volunteers to go first and is possessed by a spirit that displays a menacing focus on Riley. Joss and Hayley manage to break the connection, but only after the time limit is exceeded slightly. </p>

<p>Mia, ecstatic over the feeling the hand brought her, along with Hayley, Joss, and Jade's boyfriend Daniel all gather at Jade's house the next night. Jade refuses to let Riley participate, but all of the others indulge, enjoying the euphoria of possession. When Jade leaves the room, Mia gives in and lets Riley take a turn. Riley appears to be possessed by Rhea's spirit, who attempts to reconcile with Mia. Mia stops the group from ending the possession to keep talking to Rhea, disregarding the time limit. Riley's body is overtaken by the spirits, who make him attempt suicide by repeatedly smashing his face against the table, and he is hospitalized in critical condition. </p>

<p>Mia, now haunted by visions of Rhea, is turned away by Jade and her mother Sue, both of whom blame her for Riley's injuries. Having secretly taken the embalmed hand, Mia repeatedly uses it to contact Rhea, who insists that her death was accidental and that she needs to help Riley, who is still possessed and attempts suicide every time he returns to consciousness. Mia leaves the connection open and begins seeing her mother without the hand, causing her to lose her grasp on reality. </p>

<p>The friends track down Cole, who explains that a living body naturally expels invading spirits. Mia, fearing that Riley may not have time, attempts to contact him in the hospital by using the hand, but is instead shown a vision of Riley being tortured in limbo. At home, Max reads Rhea's suicide note to Mia, apologizing for hiding the truth from her. Soon afterwards, Rhea's spirit tells Mia that Max is lying. Mia hallucinates that she is being violently attacked by Max, causing her to inadvertently stab the real Max in the neck with a pair of scissors. </p>

<p>After being told by Rhea that Riley needs to die in order to be set free from his possession, and hallucinating the injured kangaroo from earlier, Mia kidnaps Riley from the hospital, intending to put him out of his misery. Jade sees her pushing him in a wheelchair toward the highway's edge. Rhea attempts to convince Mia to push Riley into oncoming traffic, but when she says "We'll have him forever", Mia realizes that "Rhea" has been the malevolent spirit from her initial possession manipulating her all along. Mia steps away from the wheelchair as Jade rushes toward them to save her brother; traffic comes to a halt and Mia lies badly injured on the road.</p>

<p>Mia suddenly finds herself in the hospital. She sees a fully recovered Riley waking up with his family, and her father leaving in an elevator going up. No one responds to her and she notices her hands are disfigured. After becoming engulfed in darkness, Mia approaches a human hand and candle in the distance, finding herself summoned at another party, where one of the partygoers says "I let you in."</p>

<h3>Critical response</h3>
<p>On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 281 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.7/10.The website's consensus reads: "With a gripping story and impressive practical effects, <i>Talk to Me</i> spins a terrifically creepy 21st-century horror yarn built on classic foundations." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 76 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.</p>

<p>Jeannette Catsoulis of <i>The New York Times</i> wrote, "Distinguished by wonderfully gooey practical effects and deeply distressing visual jolts (especially when young Riley falls under the hand's malignant influence), <i>Talk to Me</i> has a hurtling energy that's often violent but never purposefully cruel." She also applauded Wilde and Bird's performances, saying the film "owes much of its potency to Sophie Wilde's continually evolving lead performance" and "a remarkable Joe Bird." Justin Chang of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> also praised Bird and Wilde's performances, writing, "Joe Bird, in a superb and surprising performance," and, "But even when <i>Talk to Me</i> flirts with incoherence, Wilde pulls it back from the brink. More than just a great scream queen, she makes vivid sense of Mia's ravaged emotions, revealing her to be a captive less to the spirit realm than to her own inconsolable grief."</p>

<p>Jake Wilson of <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> gave the film 3Â½ out of 4 stars, writing, "The grim prologue leaves little doubt that horrible things are going to happen to people we're asked to care about â€“ and while the ending may not fully satisfy the emotional expectations that have been built up, better too few comforting explanations than too many." Peter Howell of the <i>Toronto Star</i> gave the film three out of four stars, saying the story had "shaky logic" but also "a rock-solid sense of instilling dread with a minimum of special effects and a sound design that turns the chill up to 11." David Rooney of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> praised the film, saying that it "deftly stitches its deepest fears around the idea that grief and trauma can be open invitations to predatory forces from the great beyond. It marks a welcome splash of new blood on the horror landscape." Rooney also applauded the performances, writing, "While the predominantly young cast is solid, especially Bird as Riley, talented newcomer Wilde does the heaviest dramatic lifting."</p>
