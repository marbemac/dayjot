<p>The <b>DC Universe Animated Original Movies</b> (<b>DCUAOM</b>; also known as <b>DC Universe Original Movies</b> or <b>DC Universe Movies</b> or <b>DC Animated Movies</b>) are a series of American direct-to-video superhero animated films based on DC Comics characters and stories. From 2007 to 2022, films were produced primarily by Warner Bros. Animation, but will fall under DC Studios Animation. Many films are usually stand-alone projects that are either adaptations of popular works or original stories. From 2013 to 2020, the DC Animated Movie Universe was a subset of this series featuring several films that took place in a shared universe, influenced predominantly by "The New 52". </p>

<p>As of 2023, the DCUAOM line released 51 movies that made a total of $228 million in sales in the United States and Canada, an average of $5.4 million per film.</p>

<p>Unlike earlier animated DC films (most of which also involved Bruce Timm and were part of the DC animated universe), the films in the line are aimed at a more adult audience, often containing profane language, stronger violence, sexual scenes and more mature themes. The art styles for the films are also generally more realistically proportionate. The majority of the films are rated PG-13 by the MPAA with the exception of <i>All-Star Superman</i> and <i>Green Lantern: Emerald Knights</i>, which are rated PG, and <i>Batman: The Killing Joke</i>, <i>Justice League Dark</i>, <i>Batman: Gotham by Gaslight</i>, <i>Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay</i>, <i>Justice League Dark: Apokolips War</i>, <i>Batman: Soul of the Dragon</i>, <i>Batman: The Long Halloween, Part Two</i>, <i>Injustice</i>, and <i>Justice League: Warworld</i>, which are rated R. Many of the films are adapted from stories originally featured in DC print comics and graphic novels. As of 2022, 47 feature films and fourteen short films have been released, with additional films slated for future releases until 2023.</p>

<p>In terms of continuity, the films are usually stand-alone, with exceptions being <i>Superman/Batman: Public Enemies</i> and its sequel <i>Superman/Batman: Apocalypse</i>, <i>Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths</i> and its sequel <i>Justice League: Doom</i>, the DC Animated Movie Universe, and the Tomorrowverse.</p>

<p>From 2007 to 2015, most of the films were voice directed by Andrea Romano, the last one being <i>Justice League: Gods and Monsters</i>, while the films since 2016 starting with <i>Batman: Bad Blood</i> were voice directed by Wes Gleason.</p>

<p>The films are generally released direct-to-video, but <i>Batman: The Killing Joke</i>, <i>Batman and Harley Quinn</i>, <i>The Death of Superman</i> and <i>Reign of the Supermen</i> were also given limited releases in theaters.</p>

<li>Timm has mentioned that another <i>Batman Beyond</i> film is a possibility, and in August 2017, Tucker stated in his Twitter account that discussions about a possible <i>Batman Beyond</i> film occur several times at the studio, while he also stated that a potential <i>Static Shock</i> film set in the DC Animated Universe is possible as the studio is always interested in Static.</li>
<li>J. M. DeMatteis expressed interest in scripting an adaptation of his Batman story arc <i>Going Sane</i> and a New Gods film set in the DC Animated Movie Universe.

<p>In 2010, Timm stated that the production team originally planned to make an Aquaman film, but at the end, the executives of Warner Bros. cancelled the project because their expectations about marketing were very low.</p>

<p>During an interview in October 2016, Jay Oliva revealed that he had an idea for a sequel to <i>Batman: Assault on Arkham</i>, but following Oliva's departure from Warner Bros. Animation in 2017, the project may have been pulled.</p>

<p>In 2023, the creative team for <i>Justice League: Warworld</i> planned to develop a film adaptation of the <i>Kingdom Come</i> comic book mini-series, but the idea was discarded by James Gunn and Peter Safran after they were named CEOs of DC Studios.</p>
