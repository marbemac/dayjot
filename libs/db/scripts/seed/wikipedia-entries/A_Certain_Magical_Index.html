<div>Japanese light novel series</div>



<p><i><b>A Certain Magical Index</b></i> (Japanese: とある魔術の禁書目録（インデックス）, Hepburn: <i>Toaru Majutsu no Indekkusu</i>) is a Japanese light novel series written by Kazuma Kamachi and illustrated by Kiyotaka Haimura, which has been published by ASCII Media Works under their Dengeki Bunko imprint since April 2004 in a total of three separate series. The first ran from April 2004 to October 2010, the second from March 2011 to July 2019, and the third from February 2020 to present.</p>

<p>The plot is set in a world where supernatural abilities exist. The light novels focus on Toma Kamijo, a young high school student in Academy City with an unusual ability in his right hand as he encounters an English nun named Index. His ability, which allows him to cancel other powers by touching them, and his relationship with Index prove dangerous to other sorcerers and espers who wanted to discover the secrets behind him and Index, as well as the city.</p>

<p>A manga adaptation by Chuya Kogino began serialization in <i>Monthly Shōnen Gangan</i> in April 2007. J.C.Staff produced two 24-episode anime series between 2008 and 2011. An animated film was released in February 2013. A 26-episode third season aired between 2018 and 2019. Several spin-offs and other adaptations have also been made, including several video games.</p>

<p>After being rejected for the Dengeki Novel Prize, Kamachi was contacted by Kazuma Miki, an editor at ASCII Media Works who had him write several test novels. He got the chance to write a full series and decided to create it with the concept of exploring the rules of magic, rather than just having it exist, and the inclusion of science to oppose its elements. The resulting series has seen success with both critics and audiences, with critics praising the action and characters.</p>



<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<h3>Setting</h3>
<p><i>A Certain Magical Index</i> is set in a world where supernatural abilities are a reality. Individuals who possess special powers acquired via science are called Espers (超能力者, <i>Chōnōryokusha</i>). Those Espers who gain their abilities without the aid of special scientific instruments, whether at birth or otherwise, are referred to as Gemstones (原石, <i>Genseki</i>). Others, known as Sorcerers (魔術師, <i>Majutsushi</i>), gain their powers upon mastering the power of magic, either from obtaining knowledge from different mythologies or by using mystical artifacts, although the existence of sorcerers is a secret to the public. While Sorcerers align themselves with different beliefs, Espers are aligned with scientific institutions. This leads to a power struggle between the magic and science factions for control of the world.</p>

<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>The story is set in Academy City (学園都市, <i>Gakuen Toshi</i>), a technologically advanced independent city-state located in the west of Tokyo, Japan, known for its educational and research institutions. Toma Kamijo is a student in Academy City whose right hand's power called the Imagine Breaker could negate any supernatural powers but also his luck, much to his chagrin. One day, Toma meets a young English girl named Index, a nun from Necessarius, a secret magic branch of the Church of England, whose mind had been implanted with the <i>Index Librorum Prohibitorum</i> – 103,000 forbidden magical books the Church stored in secret locations. His encounter with her leads him to meet others from the secret worlds of science and magic. Toma's unusual power places him at the center of conflicts between the Sorcerers and Espers in Academy City who planned to unravel the secrets behind Academy City, Index, and Toma's special power.</p>

<p>Besides its manga adaptation, the series also has four spin-offs focusing on other characters. One of them is <i>A Certain Scientific Railgun</i>, which focuses on Mikoto Misaka, an Electromaster and the third most powerful Esper in Academy City. The second, <i>A Certain Scientific Accelerator</i>, focuses on Accelerator, a teenager capable of controlling vectors and the most powerful Esper in Academy City. The third, <i>A Certain Scientific Dark Matter</i>, deals with the second most powerful Esper in Academy City named Teitoku Kakine and his past. The fourth, <i>A Certain Scientific Mental Out</i>, follows the fifth Level 5 Esper and most powerful psychological psychic named Misaki Shokuhō in her election campaign for the next president of Tokiwadai Middle School's student body.</p>



<h2>Development</h2>
<p>Kazuma Kamachi started his work with <i>A Certain Magical Index</i> when he received a call from Kazuma Miki, the light novel editor, after his submission was rejected at the 9th Dengeki Game Novel Prize (now Dengeki Novel Prize) in 2002. Miki began to train him in writing multiple test novels, including a story about a girl sister and a boy with a mysterious arm which became the basis for his light novel.</p>

<p>In his essay titled "If It's Interesting Anything Goes: 600 Million Copies Printed—The Day in the Life of a Certain Editor", Miki stated that the light novel was originally called <i>Last Memory</i> (ラストメモリー, <i>Rasuto Memorī</i>) but he chose the current title because the word "Index" left a "strong personality in the sense and direction" upon his reading of the manuscript. Kamachi revealed that Index's name was derived from the "Kinsho Mokuroku" (禁書目録) kanji he found from looking in the encyclopedia since he wanted a name that would "stand out for the character the story was centered around". He avoided using difficult kanji for Toma Kamijo's name to help readers able to read it but he kept the meaning behind the character's epithet ("The One Who Purifies God and Slays Demons") a secret for now.</p>

<p>When it came the time to write the story, Kamachi investigated the terms "sorcerer" and "real" online for him to build the world of magic and the magicians' existence in his light novel. He also realized that most other Dengeki Bunko novels had magic as a main theme; however, none of them actually invested much into its inner-workings. As such, he decided to use this as the premise for the series. In setting up the world of science, Kamachi "needed some kind of power to oppose" the magic side. This helped him to create the idea of Toma Kamijo's known power, the Imagine Breaker, and set the stage for the world-building of Academy City "where science, espers, and magic would gather".</p>

<p>Upon the release of the first volume of the light novel, Miki stated that "(to be blunt) it sold like crazy. Shortly after the official release date, we had to do a reprint half the size of the original printing. It was on a Monday. I still remember it now. It was quite an achievement for an unknown newcomer". After the success of the first volume, the second volume was completed in 17 days. Subsequent volumes were also completed quickly, with the story for the ninth volume completed before the release of the fifth volume.</p>
