<div>TV series or program</div>

<p><i><b>Band of Brothers</b></i> is a 2001 American war drama miniseries based on historian Stephen E. Ambrose's 1992 non-fiction book of the same name. It was created by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who also served as executive producers, and who had collaborated on the 1998 World War II film <i>Saving Private Ryan.</i> Episodes first aired on HBO starting on September 9, 2001. The series  won the Emmy and Golden Globe awards for best miniseries.</p>

<p>The series dramatizes the history of "Easy" Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, from jump training in the United States through its participation in major actions in Europe, up until Japan's capitulation and the end of World War II. The events are based on Ambrose's research and recorded interviews with Easy Company veterans. The series took some literary license, adapting history for dramatic effect and series structure. The characters portrayed are based on members of Easy Company. Excerpts from interviews with some of the survivors are used as preludes to the episodes, but they are not identified by name until the end of the finale.</p>

<p>The title of the book and series comes from the St Crispin's Day Speech in William Shakespeare's play <i>Henry V</i>, delivered by King Henry before the Battle of Agincourt. Ambrose quotes a passage from the speech on his book's first page; this passage is spoken by Carwood Lipton in the series finale.</p>



<h2>Plot</h2>
<p><i>Band of Brothers</i> is a dramatized account of "Easy Company", part of the 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, assigned to the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division during World War II. Over ten episodes the series details the company's exploits during the war.</p>

<p>Starting with jump training at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, <i>Band of Brothers</i> follows the unit through the American airborne landings in Normandy, Operation Market Garden, the Siege of Bastogne, the invasion of Germany, including the liberation of a concentration camp, and on to the war's end. It includes the taking of the <i>Kehlsteinhaus</i> (Eagle's Nest) at Obersalzberg in Berchtesgaden and refers to the surrender of Japan.</p>

<p>Major Richard Winters (1918–2011) is the central character, shown working to accomplish the company's missions and keep his men together and safe. While the series features a large ensemble cast, each episode generally focuses on a single character, following his action.</p>

<p>As the series is based on historical events, the fates of the characters reflect those of the persons on which they are based. Many either die or sustain serious wounds which lead to their being sent home. Other soldiers recover after treatment in field hospitals and rejoin their units on the front line. Their experiences, and the moral, mental, and physical hurdles they must overcome, are central to the story's narrative.</p>

In 1942, Easy Company trains at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, under First Lieutenant Herbert Sobel, a strict disciplinarian who goes out of his way to find fault with his men. The company is shipped to England in September 1943, and as training progresses, Sobel's inadequacy as a leader in the field becomes evident. Now a captain, Sobel initiates a dispute with Lieutenant Richard "Dick" Winters, leading to Winters requesting a trial by court martial. These factors lead all of Easy's non-commissioned officers to resign en masse. Colonel Robert Sink, the regiment's commander, reassigns Sobel to command of a parachuting school for essential non-infantry personnel. With new leadership, Easy Company prepares for Operation Overlord. William Guarnere learns that his older brother Henry, a medic in the 1st Armored Division fighting in Italy, has been killed at Monte Cassino.</td></tr>

<p>As Captain Lewis Nixon scrounges for his favored whisky, Vat 69, Easy Company enters Nazi Germany. Nixon is distraught at the news that his wife Katherine is divorcing him and taking everything, including his dog, and is demoted to operations officer for the regiment. Some of the men on patrol stumble across a concentration camp near Landsberg and free the surviving prisoners. The sight of the victims leaves the soldiers horrified and disgusted, and Liebgott serves as a German interpreter for Winters as they learn from one of the survivors that the prisoners are Jews and noncombatants. </p>

Easy secures food from the village for the survivors, but as they distribute it, Sink brings Major Louis Kent, the regiment's surgeon. Kent informs them that they have to stop and supervise the prisoners' food intake lest they suffer from refeeding syndrome, which in itself can be fatal. He also informs them that the survivors have to remain in the camp until they can be moved, and Liebgott reluctantly delivers the message but then breaks down. The German locals deny knowing anything about the camp. The 101st Airborne's commander, General Taylor, imposes martial law and orders all able-bodied civilians from ages 14 to 80 to clean up the camp, including removing the bodies. Nixon informs Easy that Adolf Hitler has committed suicide.</td></tr>

<p>Easy captures the Eagle's Nest in Berchtesgaden without resistance, and the end of the war in Europe is announced. Finding a collection of 10,000 bottles of liquor, wine and champagne in a cellar at Hermann Göring's house, Winters allows the company to celebrate before they travel to Austria to become an occupying force. It is then announced that the division will be redeployed to the Pacific Theater, but those with enough points will get to go home. General Taylor authorizes a drawing for each company to rotate one soldier home, and Powers wins Easy's drawing. Liebgott leads a trio that tracks down and summarily executes a concentration camp commandant at a farm. </p>

Winters applies for a transfer to the Pacific, but the officer in charge tells him his men have earned the right to keep him around. Despite the peace and the relative ease of life in Salzburg, men continue to be injured and die. Together with the rest of the battalion, Easy oversees the surrender of 25,000 German troops in Zell am See. Sobel initially does not salute Winters, but Winters reminds him that the salute is for the rank, not the man. Over a company baseball game, Winters narrates the fates of some of the men playing in it. He interrupts the game to announce the surrender of the Empire of Japan, which ends the war, and then narrates Nixon's fate and finally his own. The episode concludes with interviews with actual surviving Easy Company members.</td></tr>

<h2>Production</h2>
<p>The series was developed chiefly by Tom Hanks and Erik Jendresen, who spent months detailing the plot outline and individual episodes. Steven Spielberg served as "the final eye" and used <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, the film on which he and Hanks had collaborated, to inform the series, although Jendresen served as showrunner. Accounts of Easy Company veterans, such as Donald Malarkey, were incorporated into production to add historic detail.</p>

<h3>Budget and promotion</h3>
<img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/Band_of_Brothers_poster.jpg/220px-Band_of_Brothers_poster.jpg" height="321" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/49/Band_of_Brothers_poster.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/49/Band_of_Brothers_poster.jpg 2x" />A promotional poster for <i>Band of Brothers</i>

<p><i>Band of Brothers</i> was at the time the most expensive TV miniseries to have been made by any network.  Its budget was about $125 million, or an average of $12.5 million per episode.</p>

<p>An additional $15 million was allocated for a promotional campaign, which included screenings for World War II veterans. One was held at Utah Beach, Normandy, where U.S. troops had landed on June 6, 1944. On June 7, 2001, 47 Easy Company veterans were flown to Paris and then traveled by chartered train to the site, where the series premiered. Chrysler was a sponsor, as its Jeeps were used in the series. Chrysler spent $5 million to $15 million on its advertising campaign, using footage from <i>Band of Brothers</i>. Each of the spots was reviewed and approved by the co-executive producers Hanks and Spielberg.</p>

<p>The BBC paid £7 million ($10.1 million) as co-production partner, the most it had ever paid for a bought-in program, and screened it on BBC Two. Originally, it was to have aired on BBC One but was moved to allow an "uninterrupted ten-week run", with the BBC denying that this was because the series was not sufficiently mainstream. Negotiations were monitored by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who spoke personally to Spielberg.</p>

<h3>Location</h3>
<p>The series was shot over eight to ten months on Ellenbrooke Fields, at Hatfield Aerodrome in Hertfordshire, England. Various sets, including replicas of European towns, were built. This location had been used to shoot the film <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>. Replicas were constructed on the large open field to represent twelve different towns, among them Bastogne, Belgium; Eindhoven, Netherlands; and Carentan, France. North Weald Airfield in Essex was used for location shots depicting the take-off sequences before the D-Day Normandy landings.</p>

<p>The village of Hambleden, in Buckinghamshire, England, was used as a location extensively in the early episodes to depict the company's training in England, as well as in later scenes. The scenes set in Germany and Austria were shot in Switzerland, in and near the village of Brienz in the Bernese Oberland, and at the nearby Hotel Giessbach.</p>

<h3>Historical accuracy</h3>
<p>To preserve historical accuracy, the writers conducted additional research. One source was the memoir of Easy Company soldier David Kenyon Webster, <i>Parachute Infantry: An American Paratrooper's Memoir of D-Day and the Fall of the Third Reich</i> (1994). This was published by LSU Press, following renewed interest in World War II and more than 30 years after his death in a boating accident. In <i>Band of Brothers</i> Ambrose quoted liberally from Webster's unpublished diary entries, with permission from his estate.</p>

<p>The production team consulted Dale Dye, a retired United States Marine Corps captain and consultant on <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, as well as with most of the surviving Easy Company veterans, including Richard Winters, Bill Guarnere, Frank Perconte, Ed Heffron, and Amos Taylor. Dye (who portrays Colonel Robert Sink) instructed the actors in a 10-day boot camp at the Longmoor Military Camp in Hampshire, culminating with parachute training at RAF Brize Norton.</p>

<p>The production aimed for accuracy in the detail of weapons and costumes. Simon Atherton, the weapons master, corresponded with veterans to match weapons to scenes, and assistant costume designer Joe Hobbs used photos and veteran accounts.</p>

<p>Most actors had contact with the individuals they were to portray before filming, often by telephone. Several veterans came to the production site. Hanks acknowledged that alterations were needed to create the series: "We've made history fit onto our screens. We had to condense down a vast number of characters, fold other people's experiences into 10 or 15 people, have people saying and doing things others said or did. We had people take off their helmets to identify them, when they would never have done so in combat. But I still think it is three or four times more accurate than most films like this." As a final accuracy check, the veterans saw previews of the series and approved the episodes before they were aired.</p>

<p>Shortly after the premiere of the series, Tom Hanks asked Major Winters what he thought of <i>Band of Brothers</i>. The major responded, "I wish that it would have been more authentic. I was hoping for an 80 percent solution." Hanks responded, "Look, Major, this is Hollywood. At the end of the day we will be hailed as geniuses if we get this 12 percent right. We are going to shoot for 17 percent."</p>

<img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/506_Inf_Rgt_DUI.jpg" height="170" width="138" />The 506th PIR Unit emblem
<p>The liberation of one of the Kaufering subcamps of Dachau was depicted in episode 9 ("Why We Fight"); however, the 101st Airborne Division arrived at Kaufering Lager IV subcamp on the day after it was discovered by the 134th Ordnance Maintenance Battalion of the 12th Armored Division, on April 27, 1945. German historian and Holocaust researcher Anton Posset worked with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks as a consultant, providing photographs of the liberators and documentation of the survivor's reports he had collected over the years. The camp was reconstructed in England for the miniseries.</p>

<p>It is uncertain which Allied unit was first to reach the <i>Kehlsteinhaus</i>. Several claim the honor, compounded by confusion with the town of Berchtesgaden, which was taken on May 4 by forward elements of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division. Reputedly members of the 7th went as far as the elevator to the <i>Kehlsteinhaus</i>, with at least one individual claiming he and a partner continued on to the top. However, the 101st Airborne maintains it was first both to Berchtesgaden and the Kehlsteinhaus. Elements of the French 2nd Armored Division, Laurent Touyeras, Georges Buis and Paul Répiton-Préneuf, were present on the night of May 4 to 5, and took several photographs before leaving on May 10 at the request of US command, and this is supported by testimonies of the Spanish soldiers who went along with them.</p>

<p>Major Dick Winters, who commanded the 2nd Battalion of the U.S. 506th PIR in May 1945, stated that they entered Berchtesgaden shortly after noon on May 5. He challenged competing claims stating, "If the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Division was first in Berchtesgaden, just where did they go? Berchtesgaden is a relatively small community. I walked into the Berchtesgaden Hof with Lieutenant Welsh and saw nobody other than some servants. Goering's Officers' Club and wine cellar certainly would have caught the attention of a French soldier from LeClerc's 2nd Armored Division, or a rifleman from the U.S. 3rd Division. I find it hard to imagine, if the 3rd Division was there first, why they left those beautiful Mercedes staff cars untouched for our men."</p>



<h2>Reception</h2>

<h3>Critical reception</h3>
<p><i>Band of Brothers</i> has a 97% approval rating with an average score of 8.80/10 based on 33 reviews from Rotten Tomatoes. The website's critics consensus is, "<i>Band of Brothers</i> offers a visceral, intense look at the horrors of war – and the sacrifices of the millions of ordinary people who served." While on Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the miniseries received a score of 87 out of 100, based on 28 reviews.</p>

<p>CNN's Paul Clinton said that the miniseries "is a remarkable testament to that generation of citizen soldiers, who responded when called upon to save the world for democracy and then quietly returned to build the nation that we now all enjoy, and all too often take for granted". Caryn James of <i>The New York Times</i> called it "an extraordinary 10-part series that masters its greatest challenge: it balances the ideal of heroism with the violence and terror of battle, reflecting what is both civilized and savage about war." James also remarked on the generation gap between most viewers and characters, suggesting this was a significant hurdle. Robert Bianco of <i>USA Today</i> wrote that the series was "significantly flawed and yet absolutely extraordinary—just like the men it portrays," rating the series four out of four stars. He noted however that it was hard to identify with individual characters during crowded battle scenes.</p>

<p>Philip French of <i>The Guardian</i> commented that he had "seen nothing in the cinema this past year that impressed me as much as BBC2's 10-part <i>Band of Brothers</i>, produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, and Ken Loach's <i>The Navigators</i> on Channel 4", and that it was "one of the best films ever made about men in war and superior in most ways to <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>." Matt Seaton, also in <i>The Guardian</i>, wrote that the film's production was "on such a scale that in an ad hoc, inadvertent way it gives one a powerful sense of what really was accomplished during the D-Day invasion - the extraordinary logistical effort of moving men and matériel in vast quantities."</p>

<p>Tom Shales of <i>The Washington Post</i> wrote that though the series is "at times visually astonishing," it suffers from "disorganization, muddled thinking and a sense of redundancy." Shales observed that the characters are hard to identify: "Few of the characters stand out strikingly against the backdrop of the war. In fact, this show is all backdrop and no frontdrop. When you watch two hours and still aren't quite sure who the main characters are, something is wrong."</p>

<p><i>Band of Brothers</i> has become a benchmark for World War II series. The German series <i>Generation War,</i> for example, was characterized by critics as <i>Band of Brüder</i> (the German word for "Brothers").</p>

<h3>Ratings</h3>
<p><i>Band of Brothers</i>' September 9, 2001 premiere drew 10 million viewers. Two days later, the September 11 attacks occurred, and HBO immediately ceased its marketing campaign. Hence, while the second episode drew 7.2 million viewers, the last episode received 5.1 million viewers, the smallest audience.</p>

<h3>Awards and nominations</h3>
<p>The series was nominated for twenty Primetime Emmy Awards, and won seven, including Outstanding Miniseries and Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie, or Dramatic Special. It also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television, American Film Institute Award for TV Movie or Miniseries of the Year, Producers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Producer of Long-Form Television, and the TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Movies, Miniseries, and Specials.</p>

<p>The show was selected for a Peabody Award for ' ... relying on both history and memory to create a new tribute to those who fought to preserve liberty.' In September 2019, <i>The Guardian</i> ranked the show 68th on its list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century, stating that it "expanded the horizons – and budgets – of prestige TV".</p>
