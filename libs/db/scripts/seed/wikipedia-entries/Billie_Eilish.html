<p>Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell was born in Los Angeles, California, on December 18, 2001. She is the daughter of actress and teacher Maggie Baird and actor Patrick O'Connell, both of whom are also musicians and work on Eilish's tours. Eilish is of Irish and Scottish descent. She was conceived via in vitro fertilization. Her middle name, Eilish, was originally meant to be her first name, while Pirate was to be her middle name. She was raised in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Eilish and her brother Finneas were homeschooled by Baird, a decision their parents made to spend time with them and give them the freedom to pursue their interests. Baird taught Eilish and Finneas the basics of songwriting. Eilish said her brother and mother inspired her to get into music. Their parents encouraged the siblings to express themselves and explore whatever they wanted, including art, dancing, and acting. Eilish also performed at talent shows and joined the Los Angeles Children's Chorus at age eight. At age six, she started playing the ukulele. She wrote her first "real" song at age 11 for her mother's songwriting class. The song is about the zombie apocalypse, inspired by the television series <i>The Walking Dead</i> from which she took script lines and episode titles for the song. Eilish had gone on some acting auditions, which she disliked; however, she enjoyed recording background dialogue for crowd scenes and worked on the films <i>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</i>, <i>Ramona and Beezus</i>, and the <i>X-Men</i> series. Eilish also took dance classes until 2016, when a growth plate injury put an end to her dancing career and she turned her focus toward recording music.</p>



<h2>Career</h2>
<h3>2015–2017: <i>Don't Smile at Me</i></h3>
<div>Main article: <i>Don't Smile at Me</i></div>
<p>In 2015, 13-year-old Eilish began working on songs with her brother Finneas, who had been writing and producing for several years and had his own band. The first songs they recorded together were called "She's Broken" and "Fingers Crossed", the former written by Finneas and the latter by Eilish. "We recorded them and put them out on SoundCloud, just for fun," she recalled.</p>

<p>On November 18, 2015, Eilish released the song "Ocean Eyes". The track was written, mixed, and produced by Finneas, who had originally created it for his band the Slightlys, before deciding it would be a better fit for Eilish's vocals. He gave it to Eilish when her dance teacher at the Revolution Dance Center asked them to write a song for choreography. The siblings uploaded the song to SoundCloud, where Diaz could access and download it. The song received several hundred thousand listens in two weeks, and Finneas's manager, Danny Rukasin, reached out to him to discuss Eilish's potential. Rukasin felt she could achieve significant success with Finneas's help.</p>

<p>In January 2016, Finneas and his manager arranged a deal in which Apple Music signed Eilish to A&amp;R company Platoon, specializing in packaging emerging artists before they get a major-label contract. Eilish then got a publicist, who connected her to the luxury fashion brand Chanel, and a stylist, both of whom helped shape her image. On March 24, 2016, a music video for "Ocean Eyes" directed by Megan Thompson was premiered on Eilish's official YouTube channel. "Ocean Eyes" and Eilish would receive praise and promotion from various media outlets and marketers, including radio stations and music supervisors such as Beats 1, KCRW, BBC Radio 1, Zane Lowe, Jason Kramer, Annie Mac, and Chris Douridas.</p>

<p>On June 23, 2016, Eilish and Finneas released "Six Feet Under" through SoundCloud as her second single. A homemade music video for the song was released on June 30, 2016. It was directed by Eilish and edited by her mother, Maggie Baird.</p>

<p>In August 2016, Justin Lubliner, who had noticed Eilish's talent back in 2015 when he first heard "Ocean Eyes", signed her to Darkroom and Interscope Records. He developed her rollout as an artist, taking inspiration from the model of hip hop artists such as Travis Scott and Chance the Rapper, not relying on one big single and focusing on creating a "persona and distinct aesthetic". Darkroom and Interscope Records re-released "Six Feet Under" and "Ocean Eyes" as singles for digital download and streaming on November 17 and 18, 2016, respectively. On November 22, 2016, a dance performance music video for "Ocean Eyes" was uploaded to Eilish's YouTube channel.</p>

<p>On January 14, 2017, Eilish released an EP with four remixes by Astronomyy, Blackbear, Goldhouse, and Cautious Clay for "Ocean Eyes", and released another EP for "Six Feet Under" featuring remixes by Blu J, Gazzo, Jerry Folk, and Aire Atlantica. Following the success of the "Ocean Eyes" remixes, Eilish released "Bellyache" on February 24, 2017, A music video for the song was released on March 22, 2017, and was directed by Miles and AJ. Eilish later released "Bored" on March 30, 2017, as part of the soundtrack to the Netflix series <i>13 Reasons Why</i>. A music video for "Bored" was later released on June 26, 2017.

Eilish embarked on the Don't Smile at Me Tour throughout October 2017 in support of her EP. Eilish released "Bitches Broken Hearts" through SoundCloud on November 10, 2017.</p>

<p>Eilish's team worked with Spotify, which promoted her on its most popular playlist, "Today's Top Hits". <i>The Baffler</i> described Eilish's sound as fitting into the "streambait" genre consisting of largely "mid-tempo, melancholy pop" influenced by Lana Del Rey, whose "singing style, bleakness, and... hip-hop influenced production" shaped the aesthetic. Eilish's commercial success expanded with her Spotify promotion. In September 2017, Apple Music named Eilish their Up Next artist, which followed with a short documentary, a live session EP and an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's radio station Beats 1. That month, the live EP titled <i>Up Next Session: Billie Eilish</i> was released. On December 15, 2017, Eilish released her collaboration with American rapper Vince Staples titled "&amp;Burn", which is a remix of her previously released single "Watch". It was later included on the expanded edition of <i>Don't Smile at Me.</i></p>

<p>On the day of release for her single "When the Party's Over", Eilish was featured in <i>Vanity Fair</i>'s "73 Questions" rapid-fire questionnaire video series by Joe Sabia who revisited a previous interview from October 2017. The resulting video was a side-by-side time capsule of both interviews showing her growth in popularity over one year. She signed a talent contract with Next Management for fashion and beauty endorsements in October 2018. She was placed on the 2018 Forbes 30 Under 30 list in November of that year, and released the single "Come Out and Play" in November 2018, which was written for a holiday-themed Apple commercial. In early January 2019, <i>Don't Smile at Me</i> reached 1billion streams on Spotify, making her the youngest artist to top 1billion streams on a project. That month, Eilish released "Bury a Friend" as the third single from her debut album <i>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</i>, along with "When I Was Older", a single inspired by the 2018 film <i>Roma</i>, which appeared on the compilation album <i>Music Inspired by the Film Roma</i>.

<p><i>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</i> was released on March 29, 2019. Spotify launched a "multi-level campaign behind the album", creating a multi-media playlist and "new product features" that Spotify stated "allow for vertical video content, custom assets, and editorial storylines all with the goal of creating more meaningful and engaging context for [Eilish's] fans." In Los Angeles, Spotify set up a "pop-up enhanced album experience", which included different artwork and a "multi-sensory" experience of each track for fans. The album debuted atop the <i>Billboard 200</i> as well as on the UK Albums Chart, making Eilish the first artist born in the 2000s to have a number-one album in the United States, and the youngest female ever to have a number-one album in the United Kingdom. Upon the album's debut, Eilish broke the record for most simultaneously charting Hot 100 songs by a female artist, with 14, after every song from the album, excluding "Goodbye", charted on the Hot 100. The fifth single from the album, "Bad Guy", was released in conjunction with the album. A remix of the song featuring Justin Bieber was released in July 2019.

<p>"Lo Vas a Olvidar", a single featuring Rosalía as a part of HBO's <i>Euphoria</i> soundtrack, was released in January 2021, almost two years after initially teasing the song. The R. J. Cutler–directed documentary film <i>Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry</i> was released on Apple TV+ and in select movie theaters. The film was praised by critics and fans for its in-depth look at Eilish's personal life during her ascension to fame. At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, Eilish took home two awards: the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media, for her Bond theme and the Grammy Award for Record of the Year for her 2019 single "Everything I Wanted". In her acceptance speech for Record of the Year, Eilish said that Megan Thee Stallion "deserved to win", but still thanked her fans and her brother Finneas for her award.</p>

<p>On April 27, 2021, Eilish announced on her Instagram account that her second album, <i>Happier Than Ever</i>, would be released on July 30, and the tracklist was made available on Apple Music. The album was released on various formats, including collectable vinyl and cassette colours. The album's release was preceded by five singles: "My Future", "Therefore I Am", "Your Power", "Lost Cause", and "NDA", and was accompanied by the title track. On December 2, 2021, Eilish announced an eco-friendly limited-edition vinyl version of <i>Happier Than Ever</i> made from recycled vinyl scraps. The collector's item was only made available at a number of Gucci stores around the world and included Gucci-branded nail stickers designed by the brand's creative director Alessandro Michele. To further promote the album, Eilish worked with Disney+ for the concert film <i>Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles</i>, released in September 2021, and embarked on the Happier Than Ever, The World Tour, which began in February 2022 and concluded in April 2023.</p>

<p>In June 2021, Eilish was criticized online for videos in which she mouthed the anti-Asian slur "chink" while lip-syncing the song "Fish" by Tyler, the Creator, while Matthew Tyler Vorce, her reported boyfriend at the time, received criticism for alleged social media posts in which he used offensive language and slurs against gay and Black people. Eilish was also accused of queerbaiting after using the caption "I love girls" to promote the music video for "Lost Cause". On June 22, she posted an apology to Instagram stories for her usage of "chink", saying that she was "appalled and embarrassed" by the video and that she was "13 or 14" at the time and did not know the slur was a derogatory term. She also addressed a separate video of what was viewed as her mocking an Asian accent, writing that she was actually "speaking in a silly gibberish made up voice". Reflecting on the events in a July 2021 interview, Eilish stated: "I said so many things then that I totally don't agree with now, or think the opposite thing. The weirdest thing is how nothing ever goes away once it's on the internet ... When you're a fucking teenager, you don't really know yourself ... I didn't actually know how I really felt. So I just came up with this facade that I stuck to."</p>

<p>Eilish started formulating ideas for her third studio album's songs with Finneas in December 2021. In a July 2022 interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, she commented that she hoped to start writing the album in 2023. In 2022, Eilish won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the song "No Time to Die" from the film of the same name, becoming the first person born in the 21st century to win an Academy Award. That same year, she became the youngest headliner to date for two festivals, specifically Glastonbury and Coachella. The Pixar film <i>Turning Red</i> was released that year, for which she and Finneas wrote three songs. These are "Nobody Like U", "U Know What's Up" and "1 True Love", which are performed by <i>Turning Red</i>'s fictional boy band 4*Town.</p>

<p>In June 2022, during her world tour's Manchester show, Eilish debuted the then-unreleased ballad "TV". The song references the overturning of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, a case which made abortion a constitutional right in the US. The next month, on July 21, she surprise-released the two-track EP <i>Guitar Songs</i>, which includes "TV" alongside "The 30th". Eilish explained her decision to surprise-release the EP during the interview with Lowe. She told him that while work on her third studio album was coming soon, she refused to wait until that time to put "TV" and "The 30th" on a track list. She wanted to spread their messages to her fans as soon as possible, noting the immediacy of its lyrics: "These songs are really current for me, and they’re songs that I want to have said right now." Another reason was Eilish had grown tired of doing heavy, traditional promotion for upcoming music. She wanted to release songs like she had been doing early in her career, previewing them for fans in live concerts before releasing them without much marketing.</p>

<p>Eilish worked with Apple Music to exclusively host a film of one of the <i>Happier Than Ever</i> tour concerts, specifically one of her shows at The O2 Arena in London. She billed the film as a way for fans who missed out on tickets to experience the tour for themselves, wanting more people to recognize her for her showmanship live. Three concerts, titled Happier Than Ever, The Hometown Encore, were held at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California from December 13 to 16, 2022, as part of the tour.</p>

<p>Eilish wrote the song "What Was I Made For?" for the soundtrack of the 2023 movie <i>Barbie</i>. According to statements posted on the singer's statements on social media, she was inspired to write the song after seeing unfinished scenes of the movie during its production.</p>

<p>Eilish made her acting debut in Amazon Prime Video's <i>Swarm</i>. She played the role of Eva, the leader of a cult inspired by NXIVM, and received positive reviews for her character.</p>

<p>Eilish possesses a soprano vocal range. Avery Stone of <i>Noisey</i> described her vocals as "ethereal", and Maura Johnston of <i>Rolling Stone</i> characterized them as "whispery". Doreen St. Félix of <i>The New Yorker</i> opined that she has a "husky, slurring voice that she can thin out to reedy". Music critic Robert Christgau wrote that while Eilish is musically and commercially pop, her brand also "reminds us how amorphous [pop] has become", describing her soprano as "too diminutive for vocal calisthenics", adding that her "playful version of teen-goth angst" and "electro-saturated debut album" captivated a diverse audience. Her music incorporates pop, dark pop, electropop, emo pop, experimental pop, goth-pop, indie pop, teen pop, and alt-pop.</p>

<p>Eilish and her brother, Finneas, collaborate on songwriting. Finneas writes for Eilish's albums, produces her music, and also performs in live shows. Eilish and Finneas "like to completely make up things and become characters" and "have songs that are really fictional". Eilish said a number of the songs also derive from her and Finneas' experiences. They try to write "really interesting and conversational" lyrics: "We try to say stuff that doesn't have to be that deep [...] but you say something way deeper in a certain way that makes sense, but you haven't really thought about." Finneas has stated that when he writes for his sister, he aims to "write [songs] that I think she'll relate to and enjoy singing and empathise with the lyrics and make her own". When he writes with Eilish, he tries "to help her tell whatever story she's trying to tell, bounce ideas off of her, listen to her ideas", and use a language that fits her voice telling the story.</p>

<p>Eilish had wanted to direct her own music videos since age 14 but was initially not given the opportunity due to lack of experience. In 2019, she made her directorial debut with the video for her song "Xanny".</p>

<h3>Influences</h3>
<p>Eilish grew up listening to the Beatles, Justin Bieber, Green Day, the 1975, Arctic Monkeys, Linkin Park and Lana Del Rey. She has said that stumbling upon Aurora's "Runaway" on YouTube inspired her to pursue a music career. Hip hop is her favorite genre and biggest inspiration.</p>

<p>She has recounted that Matty Healy was an early inspiration for her: "His show is the second show I ever went to in my life. He changed so much about who I am, how I write music." She has also noted Tyler, the Creator, Childish Gambino, and Avril Lavigne as major musical and style influences for her. Other influences include Adele, Earl Sweatshirt, James Blake, Amy Winehouse, the Spice Girls, Lorde, Marina and the Diamonds, Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, XXXTentacion, and Twenty One Pilots. She has also shown appreciation for Paramore after inviting Hayley Williams to join her set during Williams' first Coachella set to perform an acoustic version of "Misery Business" and sing her song, "Happier Than Ever". Eilish has also named Rihanna as an inspiration for her style choices after she called fashion her "defense mechanism" during an acceptance speech. She has also credited Damon Albarn for changing the way she views art and music creation.</p>

<p>Eilish has been compared in the media to Lavigne, Lorde and Del Rey, the last of whom she says she does not want to be compared to, stating, "That woman [Del Rey] has made her brand so perfect for her whole career and she shouldn't have to hear that." Eilish said that Ariana Grande's 2019 album <i>Thank U, Next</i> inspired her to continue making music.</p>

<p>Eilish is the recipient of numerous awards, including seven Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, two MTV Europe Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, an Academy Award, two Guinness World Records, one Brit Award, and three <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards.</p>

<p>In 2019, <i>Time</i> placed her on their inaugural "Time 100 Next" list. She is the youngest person, second person ever, and first female artist to win the four main Grammy categories—Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year—in the same year. In 2022, she became the first person born in the 21st century ever to win an Academy Award, receiving the award for Best Original Song for "No Time to Die" from the James Bond film of the same name. In 2023, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked Eilish at number 198 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.</p>

<h3>Style</h3>
<p>Much of the media attention surrounding Eilish has revolved around her fashion style, which consists primarily of baggy, oversized clothing. In 2017, she stated that she likes dressing out of her comfort zone to feel like she grabs the attention of everyone around her. She tries to be "really different from a lot of people" and dresses opposite to what others wear. Aiming to "look memorable", Eilish said that she "proved to people that [she's] more important than they think" and likes being "kind of intimidating, so people will listen up." In 2019, she stated: "Over time it's kind of become a thing, 'Billie Eilish, the creepy, weird, scary girl.' And I don't like that. It's lame. I just don't want to stay one thing."</p>

<p>In May 2019, Eilish appeared in a Calvin Klein advertisement, where she mentioned that she dresses in baggy clothes to prevent people from judging her body. In a March 2020 live show in Miami, as part of the Where Do We Go? Tour, she premiered <i>Not My Responsibility</i>, a short film which addresses her experiences of body shaming. <i>Not My Responsibility</i> was later uploaded to Eilish's YouTube channel in May 2020.</p>

<p>Eilish was on the cover of the June 2021 issue of <i>British Vogue</i>. The photoshoot by Craig McDean featured her dressed in lingerie, specifically focused on corsets. Eilish made her first appearance at the Met Gala in 2021, which had the theme "In America: A Lexicon of Fashion", wearing an Oscar de la Renta gown under the condition that the fashion house would permanently end its use of real fur. Though the dress was inspired by the original Barbie doll, fashion critics observed its likeness to Golden Age star Marilyn Monroe, who also wore a tulle Oscar de la Renta gown in the early 1950s.</p>

<h3>Products and endorsements</h3>
<p>In April 2019, Eilish released clothing in collaboration with Takashi Murakami, inspired by her music video for "You Should See Me in a Crown", also directed and animated by Murakami, as well as a limited edition vinyl figure of herself from the video. Eilish also collaborated with Adobe Creative Cloud the same month for a series of advertisements as well as a social media art contest, where users would submit artwork with the hashtag "#BILLIExADOBE".</p>

<p>Eilish appeared in the debut of Calvin Klein's #MyCalvins ad campaign in May 2019, as well as the Ad Council's "Seize the Awkward" campaign, a series of public service announcements targeting mental health awareness. She fronted MCM Worldwide's fall 2019 advertising campaign in July 2019, and later that month, collaborated with Los Angeles-based clothing brand Freak City for a clothing line. Also in July 2019, she performed at a dinner hosted by Chanel on Shelter Island to celebrate the brand's pop-up yacht club.</p>

<p>In August 2019, Eilish partnered with Apple to allow Apple Store customers to experiment with her song "You Should See Me in a Crown" in Music Lab sessions in its stores. Eilish's collaboration with the clothing company Siberia Hills was met with controversy after it was revealed that the company had used plagiarized designs of fan art of the character Nozomi Tojo from <i>Love Live!</i>, drawn by artist Makoto Kurokawa, for Eilish's clothing line. The brand later clarified that Eilish herself had no knowledge of the plagiarism.</p>

<p>In November 2021, she  debuted "Eilish", her perfume brand, which is  vegan and cruelty-free.</p>



<h2>Advocacy</h2>
<p>Eilish has a history of political activism, publicly expressing her views on a multitude of political issues. She has been vocal with regards to environmental causes, including climate change awareness. Among other pursuits, Eilish signed an open letter to world leaders urging them to take action against climate-induced poverty, embarked on an ad campaign encouraging young people to use technology for environmental advocacy, and hosted a six-day climate seminar in London titled Overheated to discuss topics such as sustainable fashion and youth activism. Her 2019 single "All the Good Girls Go to Hell"  and its subsequent music video centers around climate change and uses heaven-and-hell imagery to criticize ignorance about rising sea levels, and she permitted the non-profit CoralWatch to use "Ocean Eyes" as part of an online awareness campaign about Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Eilish was raised as a vegetarian, is a regular advocate on social media for animal rights and veganism, and has criticized the dairy, wool, and mink fur industries.</p>

<p>Eilish has spoken in multiple occasions about women's rights. A supporter of body positivity, she wrote and produced the 2020 short film <i>Not My Responsibility</i> as a response against body shaming towards her and the double standards placed upon women's appearances. "Your Power", one of her 2021 singles, criticizes the sexual exploitation of young women, primarily by men who hold power over them. Eilish associates herself with the US abortion rights movement; she expressed rage when Texas implemented its anti-abortion laws in 2021. During the 2022 Glastonbury festival, she performed "Your Power" to condemn the overturning of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. She spoke of the decision: "Today is a really, really dark day for women in the U.S. I'm just going to say that as I cannot bear to think about it any longer in this moment." She included a reference to <i>Roe v. Wade</i>'s overturning in her 2022 track "TV", much of which she wrote after a draft of the court decision was leaked online in May.</p>

<p>In March 2020, Eilish encouraged fans online to register to vote for the 2020 US presidential election. In August 2020, she performed at the 2020 Democratic National Convention and announced her endorsement of Joe Biden's presidential campaign.</p>



<h2>Personal life</h2>
<p>Eilish previously lived with her parents in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles until 2019, when she moved out. She said in 2021 that she still spends many nights in her childhood bedroom to be close to her parents. She stated she received a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome when she was 11; she says she has synesthesia and has experienced depression.</p>

<p>Eilish experienced sexual abuse from someone older than her when she was a child, and she has not shared specific details about it.</p>

<p>Eilish previously dated rapper Brandon Adams, who goes by the stage name 7:AMP. Eilish dated singer Jesse Rutherford from October 2022 to May 2023.</p>
