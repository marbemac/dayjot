<h1>The Eras Tour</h1>

<div>2023–2024 concert tour by Taylor Swift</div>
<div>For the concert film, see <i>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour</i>.</div>



<p><b>The Eras Tour</b> is the ongoing sixth concert tour by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, who described it as a journey through all of her musical "eras". An homage to her albums, the Eras Tour is her most expansive tour yet, with 146 dates across five continents. It is her second all-stadium tour after the 2018 Reputation Stadium Tour.</p>

<p>Announced after the release of her tenth studio album, <i>Midnights</i> (2022), the Eras Tour commenced on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, United States, and is set to conclude on November 23, 2024, in Toronto, Canada. The show spans over three hours, with a set list of 44 songs divided into 10 distinct acts that portray the albums conceptually. It received unanimous acclaim from critics, who emphasized its concept, production, aesthetics and immersive ambience, as well as Swift's musicianship, vocals, stamina, and versatility.</p>

<p>The tour had a significant cultural, economic and political impact, evident in the form of unprecedented demand, ticket sales, technical obstacles leading to the imposition of price regulation and anti-scalping laws, venue attendance records, elevated economies, businesses, and tourism, domination of news cycles and social media, and tributes from governments and organizations. Ticketmaster, an official partner, was scrutinized for ineffective sales and alleged monopoly. As of August 2023, the Eras Tour is the highest-grossing tour ever by a woman and the second highest-grossing overall.</p>

<p>Swift announced and released various works during the tour: extended editions of <i>Midnights,</i> the re-recorded albums <i>Speak Now (Taylor's Version)</i> and <i>1989 (Taylor's Version)</i>, the music videos for "Karma" and "I Can See You", and "Cruel Summer" as a single. An accompanying concert film was released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, and became the highest-grossing concert film in history.</p>

<p>Taylor Swift embarked on the Reputation Stadium Tour, her fifth concert tour, in 2018, in support of her sixth studio album, <i>Reputation</i> (2017). It broke the record for the highest-grossing US tour in history. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 forced Swift to cancel what would have been her sixth tour, Lover Fest, in support of her seventh studio album, <i>Lover</i> (2019). In the time since, she released three studio albums, <i>Folklore</i> (2020), <i>Evermore</i> (2020), and <i>Midnights</i> (2022); and two re-recorded albums, <i>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</i> and <i>Red (Taylor's Version)</i> in 2021.</p>

<h3>US dates</h3>
<p>During her promotion of <i>Midnights</i> on talk shows such as <i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i> and <i>The Graham Norton Show</i> in October 2022, Swift hinted at an upcoming tour. On November 1, she announced on <i>Good Morning America</i> and through her social media accounts her sixth concert tour, the Eras Tour, describing it as "a journey through the musical eras of [her] career". She first announced 27 shows across 20 US cities, beginning in March 2023 in Glendale, Arizona, and ending in August 2023 in Inglewood, California. The opening acts were Paramore, Haim, Phoebe Bridgers, Beabadoobee, Girl in Red, Muna, Gayle, Gracie Abrams, and Owenn, each two of whom shared a tour date. Messina Touring Group, an Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) partner, served as the tour's promoter.</p>

<p>Popular demand led Swift to add eight shows at some US cities on November 4, and 17 more the following week, making the Eras Tour the most extensive US tour of Swift's career (52 shows), surpassing the Reputation Stadium Tour (38). <i>Billboard</i> described the tour's announcement as "the most chaos-inducing tour announcement of the decade." Among the tour's prospective partners were the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange company FTX; a US$100 million sponsorship deal with Swift was in talks but did not materialize. On January 31, tour merchandise inspired by all of Swift's ten album "eras" were made available for purchase on her website. On August 3, Swift announced a second US leg, featuring three more cities in October and November 2024, with Abrams as the opener.</p>

<h3>International dates</h3>
<div>Further information: Impact of the Eras Tour §Demand and geopolitics</div>
<p>On June 2, 2023, Swift announced the Latin American shows of the Eras Tour, with Sabrina Carpenter as opening act. A third show in Buenos Aires was announced on June 6, hours after the public sale commenced, due to high demand. Additional shows in Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo were announced on June 12. Shows in Asia, Australia, and Europe were announced on June 20.</p>

<p>Several politicians and government officials demanded the tour be brought to their country or city. Places such as Canada and Chile were expected to be part of the tour but were absent in Swift's announcement on June 20, drawing dismay and demands from fans and officials. Across Southeast Asia, fans decried the lack of shows in countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand and demanded the tour be brought to there. In particular, her return to the Philippines had been highly anticipated. Some journalists and fans opined that unlike venues in Japan and Singapore—the only Asian countries part of the Eras Tour—those in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Thailand might not have the infrastructure required to host the tour. In addition, Hong Kong and mainland China reopened to foreigners much later than most other places following the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have affected touring plans, as per <i>South China Morning Post</i>. In Malaysia, legal opposition to LGBT rights and the ban on pop concerts during Ramadan were cited as potential reasons.</p>

<p>From June to August 2023, new shows were added to the tour. The total number of Singapore shows were increased to six; eight shows were added in Europe; two extra shows were announced for Australia; another 14 European shows were added, with Paramore announced as the leg's opening act; and six shows were announced in Toronto, Canada, with Abrams as the opener.</p>



<h2>Ticket sales</h2>
<p>Ticket sales for the Eras Tour were handled by various ticketing agencies around the world, such as Ticketmaster, over several dates. Met with unprecedented, record-setting demand, tickets at every venue sold out in hours. Sales faced technical malfunctions in many countries; bulk purchases of tickets by scalpers and bots were reported at numerous venues, resulting in tickets being listed on resale platforms for exorbitant prices. StubHub noted that the Eras Tour ticket sales were "tracking to be the best-selling of any artist [they've] seen".</p>

<h3>US and Canada</h3>
<p>The first US leg was set to go on sale to the general public on November 18, 2022. Due to Swift's multi-year partnership with Capital One, cardholders had presale access, which was set to begin on November 15. Fans registered for the Ticketmaster Verified Fan program from November 1 through 9 to receive a presale code that granted exclusive access to the TaylorSwiftTix Presale on November 15; those who purchased merchandise from Swift's website received "boosts", and previous Lover Fest ticket holders also received preferred access to the presale if they registered using the same Ticketmaster account. Swift confirmed ticket prices in advance, abandoning the "platinum ticket" model; they ranged from US$49 to $449, while VIP packages ranged from $199 to $899. According to Ticketmaster, the TaylorSwiftTix Presale provided "the best opportunity to get more tickets into the hands of fans who want to attend the show" by evading bots and scalpers. It also noted that if demand from the program "exceeds supply", it is possible that "verified fans may be selected at random to participate in the presale." It later reported that it received a record 3.5 million verified fan registrations for the Eras Tour. Ahead of the second leg's presale on August 11, Ticketmaster estimated that 14 million users were vying for roughly 625,000 tickets.</p>

<p>Ticketmaster handled the Canadian sales as well, using the Verified Fan program. Members of the Royal Bank of Canada's Avion Rewards program received exclusive access to a separate presale. An estimated 31 million people registered for the Verified Fan presale, equal to over 77 percent of Canada's population.</p>

<h4>Ticketmaster controversy</h4>
<div>Main article: 2022 Ticketmaster controversy</div>

<img alt="Federal Trade Commission Building in 2007" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Federal_Trade_Commission_DC_2007.jpg/220px-Federal_Trade_Commission_DC_2007.jpg" height="165" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Federal_Trade_Commission_DC_2007.jpg/330px-Federal_Trade_Commission_DC_2007.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Federal_Trade_Commission_DC_2007.jpg/440px-Federal_Trade_Commission_DC_2007.jpg 2x" />The United States Federal Trade Commission proposed to outlaw junk fees in the country following the controversy.

<p>On November 15, the day of the first US presale, Ticketmaster's website crashed following what <i>Variety</i> called "historically unprecedented demand". Live Nation, the parent company of Ticketmaster, said they prepared for 1.5 million verified fans, but 14 million turned up; published a statement saying they had been "unprepared" to accommodate them; and cancelled any further sales, citing inability to meet demand. The fiasco was the subject of public criticism and political scrutiny. Customers and fans criticized Ticketmaster for its allegedly flawed systems and inefficient technical resolutions. US lawmakers, including attorneys general and members of Congress, took notice of the issue, which became the focus of multiple state, federal and congressional inquiries.</p>

<p>On December 12, 2022, Ticketmaster began notifying select fans—"identified as [fans] who received a boost during the Verified Fan presale but did not purchase tickets"—of a second ticket-buying opportunity to purchase a maximum of two tickets per user through Ticketstoday. Ticketmaster sold the first US leg's remaining 170,000 tickets over four weeks.</p>

<h3>Latin America</h3>
<p>Latin American tickets went on sale in early June 2023. Presale access was granted to Banco Patagonia clients in Argentina on June 5; around one million customers were reported to have queued for the 24,000 available presale tickets for the Buenos Aires shows, and over three million during the general sale. DF Entertainment served as Swift's tour promotion partner in Argentina; CEO Diego Finkelstein called the demand "unprecedented", based on which <i>Perfil</i> opined that Swift could fill the stadium 36 times if she wanted to.</p>

<p>In Brazil, previous Lover Fest ticket holders and C6 Bank Mastercard holders gained access to presales on June 6 and 10, respectively. Instantly after the announcement of the shows on June 2, people camped outside Allianz Parque to purchase physical tickets to the São Paulo shows that would not go on sale to the general public until June 12. The Mastercard presale tickets sold out in 30 minutes, with over one million customers queueing. Unrest was reported on June 11 in the queues outside the venues' box offices as scalpers attempted to bypass fans, including some armed scalpers who threatened violence; police arrived at the scene to maintain order. On June 12, over two million users queued for the general sale online. Ticket sale agency T4F – Time For Fun was reported over 100 times to authorities. On June 20, federal lawmakers in Brazil filed the "Taylor Swift Law", which would penalize scalpers with up to four years in prison and a fine of up to 100 times the value of the ticket.</p>

<p>In Mexico, ticket presale was handled by Ticketmaster's Verified Fan program; registrations ran from June 2 through June 7, followed by a general public on-sale.</p>

<h3>Asia-Pacific</h3>
<p>In Australia, tickets were only available via Ticketek. <i>Guardian Australia</i> reported that the Australian leg was met with unprecedented demand as well. Within 12 hours, over one million people signed up for presale codes. American Express cardholders purchased VIP packages from June 26 to 28; the website crashed within half an hour, and all packages sold out on June 26. Following the scalping highlighted by Australian consumer organization Choice, the Victoria State Government declared the Eras Tour in Melbourne a "major event", a legal provision penalizing scalping and misleading advertisement in Victoria. Because reselling a ticket for more than 10% above the original price had already been illegal in New South Wales, the government investigated the ticket resale platform Viagogo after the scalping reports. On June 28, those registered with Frontier Touring Company gained access to a presale for which over four million users queued, setting a national record; tickets sold out within three hours. Ticketek stated it neutralized over 500 million bot purchase attempts during the presale. The public on-sale began on June 30, with tickets selling out that day.</p>

<p>For the Singaporean shows, United Overseas Bank (UOB) cardholders in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam had presale access on July 5, 2023, with over one million users in the virtual queue. <i>The Straits Times</i> reported that Swift's fans in Singapore and other eligible Southeast Asian countries began "scrambling" to sign up for UOB cards. Around 22 million users registered for access to the 330,000 available tickets during the July 7 general sale, which happened both virtually and via Singapore Post offices; tickets sold out immediately despite website crashes. Klook, an official experience partner for the Singapore leg, sold travel packages along with tickets, which were purchased by dozens of Filipino fans and instantly sold out. Marina Bay Sands sold tickets coupled with hotel stays and other experiences.</p>

<h3>Europe</h3>
<p>The Lisbon shows went on sale on July 12 and 27, 2023, via See Tickets, with transferrable access codes mailed to registered users, who were limited to four tickets per code. Standard tickets for both shows sold out within 2.5 hours. Three million people queued for tickets in Germany, and 600,000 registered for the Warsaw shows. All 170,000 tickets for the three Vienna shows sold out within the first few hours, marking the largest and fastest ticket sale ever in Austria. All 95,000 Zürich tickets sold out within 30 minutes.</p>

<p>In France, TF1 reported the highest demand ever for a presale. Angelo Gopee, head of Live Nation France, stated, "the demand is such that many have found themselves in a virtual queue just to subscribe to the mailing list which, potentially, will open access to the ticket office. From memory, we had never seen that in France". The Paris presale opened on June 11, 2023, to over one million queued users. Ticketmaster suspended both Paris and Lyon presales within an hour after reports of login glitches. They were rescheduled to July 17 to 21.</p>

<p>Ticketmaster and AXS handled the United Kingdom sale. Those who had previously pre-ordered <i>Midnights</i> were able to access presales from July 10 to 12. London's Wembley Stadium officials described the demand for tickets as "unprecedented" and noted that waiting times were "longer than usual". Cardiff's Principality Stadium tickets were pre-sold on July 14. In addition to website malfunctions, <i>Forbes</i> reported widespread scalping of the tour's UK tickets, with immediate re-listing on sites like StubHub and Viagogo for extortionate prices. Viagogo responded that the demand of the tour's European leg is something the company had not seen "since the Beatles". The UK general sale took place from July 17 to 19. In Ireland, around 500,000 people registered for the Dublin shows. On account of the website crashes during the UK sale, Ticketmaster announced staggered on-sale times for Dublin on July 20, 2023; tickets sold out in minutes. <i>The Irish Times</i> highlighted that, unlike the UK, "the practice of reselling tickets above face value has been illegal in Ireland since 2021", so no scalping was reported.</p>



<h2>Production</h2>
<p>The Eras Tour was produced by Swift's in-house tour production company, Taylor Swift Touring. <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> reported, the tour is one of the most expensive and "technically ambitious" productions of the 21st century. Interior design magazine <i>Architectural Digest</i> named the tour Swift's "most ambitious" set design and praised its worldbuilding.</p>

<h3>Stage and lighting</h3>
<div><div><div><div>The production consists of smoke machines, light beams, confetti shooters, coordinated serial lights, pyrotechnics, and hydraulic platforms. The middle stage has mobile blocks that elevate to form different platform shapes throughout the show.</div></div></div></div>
<p>The Eras Tour staging is expansive, made of digital displays. It consists of three separate stages connected by a broad ramp: a main stage with a giant, curved widescreen; a rhombic middle stage; and a rectangular stage that along with the ramp forms a T-shape at the middle of the floor. The stages feature various visuals and effects throughout the show. The tour's concept centers on worldbuilding, featuring a diverse set of props and performing styles to convey the varying moods and aesthetics of Swift's albums.</p>

<p>The staging is equipped with a "hyperactive" hydraulic platform, with the main and middle stages having mobile blocks that rise from the center to form platforms of different shapes. The tour's "massive" production is heavily inspired by Broadway theatre. It was described as a 4D cognitive experience, featuring pyrotechnics, laser lights, smoke machines, fire canons, indoor fireworks, PixMob LED bracelets, and image projection technology, such as projection mapping.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Designed as a tribute to Swift's discography across her 17-year career, the Eras Tour covers all styles of music from her 10 studio albums, ranging from country and pop to folk and alternative rock genres. Some media outlets dubbed the Eras Tour the "greatest hits" tour of an artist still in her commercial prime. The set list placed a somewhat greater focus on albums Swift had not previously toured, including first-ever live performances of several tracks. The concert ensemble included 14 backup dancers and a live band of six instrumentalists and four female backing vocalists. The dances were choreographed by Mandy Moore.</p>

<h3>Fashion</h3>
<div><div><div><div>Designers such as Roberto Cavalli, Zuhair Murad and Oscar de la Renta custom-made Swift's outfits for the tour to complement each album's aesthetic.</div></div></div></div>

<p>Swift's wardrobe at the Eras Tour was a subject of widespread media coverage. Her costumes and those of her accompanying dancers, as well as her microphones and guitars, paid homage to her 10 albums. They were inspired by previous performances, music videos, and public appearances, intended to align with the overarching themes and palette of the era Swift referenced in an act, showcasing the various sonic and visual aesthetics she had adopted in her career. However, crystals were an unifying fashion choice; costumes of every act were adorned with them.</p>

<p>Attire and accessories were mostly custom-made by fashion houses Swift had worked with before, such as Atelier Versace, Roberto Cavalli, Etro, Nicole + Felicia Couture, Zuhair Murad, Elie Saab, Ashish, Alberta Ferretti, Jessica Jones, and Oscar de la Renta. Swift wore variations of some costumes at different shows, usually paired with Christian Louboutin shoes. Swift's black fedora from "22" was designed by  Gladys Tamez. Fausto Puglisi, a designer for Roberto Cavalli, stated that he took an "artisanal approach to craftsmanship" while customizing the outfits, claiming "everything must be eye-catching" when designing for concerts. He incorporated Swarovski crystals in the costumes Swift wore during the <i>Fearless</i>, <i>1989</i>, and <i>Reputation</i> acts, which required over 170 hours of meticulous "hand-craftsmanship by skilled artisans" to make. The sequined tulle ball gown that Murad designed for the <i>Speak Now</i> act required "over 350 hours of atelier handwork". Ferretti used chiffon and micro-beading for the <i>Folklore</i> era dresses, while the <i>Midnights</i> Oscar de la Renta fringed bodysuit was hand-adorned with more than 5,300 beads and crystals.</p>

<p><i>StyleCaster</i> regarded the Eras Tour wardrobe as Swift's best fashion collection for a tour. <i>The New York Times</i>' chief fashion critic Vanessa Friedman considered the Eras Tour a fashion show beyond merely live music and praised Swift's "fabulous" but purposeful wardrobe choices for setting the bar high for future concerts by other artists.</p>




<h2>Concert synopsis</h2>
<div><div><div><div>Swift performing with her band during the first two acts: <i>Lover</i> (top) and <i>Fearless</i> (bottom)</div></div></div></div>

<p>An Eras Tour show is over three hours and 15 minutes long, the longest of Swift's career. It consists of 44 songs grouped into 10 acts. Each act is characterized by a specific color scheme, while transitions between acts are facilitated by on-screen interlude visuals and marked by costume changes with negligible intermissions. Swift addresses the crowd throughout the show.</p>


<p>The show commences with the <i><b>Lover</b></i> act. A clock on-screen counts down to show time as Dusty Springfield's "You Don't Own Me" (1964) plays. Surrounded by pastel-colored, fan-like tapestry, Swift emerges from the platform at mid-stage in a bodysuit and boots. She opens the show with the chorus of "Miss Americana &amp; the Heartbreak Prince" leading into "Cruel Summer". Accompanied by dancers, Swift performs "The Man" and "You Need to Calm Down" in a sequined blazer, through a set emulating office cubicles. She then delivers the welcome note with the dollhouse from the "Lover" music video on-screen, depicting her various album eras. She plays "Lover" on a guitar, followed by a stripped-down rendition of "The Archer" alone on the ramp. The second act, <i><b>Fearless</b></i>, begins with the screen showing gold electric sparks raining down. Swift reappears in a metallic fringed dress and country boots characteristic of her early style. She performs "Fearless" on the main stage, "You Belong with Me" at mid-stage, and "Love Story" on the T-stage, all alongside her band.</p>

<div><div><div><div>Swift performing "Willow" and "Look What You Made Me Do" as part of the <i>Evermore</i> (top) and <i>Reputation</i> (bottom) acts, respectively</div></div></div></div>

<p>The third act, <i><b>Evermore</b></i>, adopts a forest aesthetic. Swift begins singing "'Tis the Damn Season" in a long gown, followed by a dark theme that leads to "Willow" in a "witchy" séance; she wears a dark green cape and performs with dancers holding luminescent orange orbs. She continues with "Marjorie", then "Champagne Problems" on a moss-covered piano beneath an oak tree, concluding the act with "Tolerate It" at a dinner table reminiscent of <i>Citizen Kane</i> (1941). Snakes visuals and dimming lights start the <i><b>Reputation</b></i> act. Swift reemerges in a black-red asymmetrical catsuit with snake motifs, with female dancers wearing black-dark red gothic leotards. She delivers a high-energy performance of "...Ready for It?", "Delicate" surrounded by light beams, and "Don't Blame Me" on an elevated platform. She transitions to "Look What You Made Me Do", which features on-screen visuals of Swift from all of her eras trapped in glass boxes and dancers dressed in some of Swift's older looks. The act concludes with a snake slithering away on-screen.</p>

<p>The fifth act, <i><b>Speak Now</b></i>, begins with an abstract mosaic of purple lights on the stage. Swift, in a ball gown, walks in from the screen and performs "Enchanted"; since July 7, 2023, she also performed "Long Live" with her band. The color scheme changes to match the next act, <i><b>Red</b></i>; a dancer opens a box that plays snippets of "Red", "Everything Has Changed" or "Holy Ground", and "State of Grace". Red balloons emerge, and Swift performs "22" wearing a version of the white T-shirt and black hat from the song's music video. Near the end of the song, she greets a fan pre-selected from the audience, giving them the hat. Swift sings "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" and "I Knew You Were Trouble" with male dancers next, dressed in a red-black romper. She dons a red-black ombre coat next, and performs "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" on a guitar, backed by the band. The act concludes with artificial snow falling.</p>

Onstage is a bucolic, A-frame cabin setup, similar to the one from Swift's performance at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021), on an elevated platform with a staircase. Swift performs "Invisible String" or "The 1" on the cabin's roof, "Betty" with her band, and "The Last Great American Dynasty" with dancers dressed in period clothing. She then sings "August", which transitions to the bridge of a rock-tinged "Illicit Affairs", followed by "My Tears Ricochet" with a choreography resembling a funeral procession. Swift returns to the cabin to perform "Cardigan", ending the act with fireflies as the cabin retreats.</p>

<p><i><b>1989</b></i>, the eighth act, commences with the screen showing a neon-lit city skyline. Swift, wearing a crop top and skirt, sings "Style". Moving to mid-stage, dancers dressed in black-and-white outfits ride neon bicycles for "Blank Space" and use blue golf clubs to smash an animated Shelby Cobra car. She follows with "Shake It Off", performed as a robust dance party; "Wildest Dreams", backed with clips of a couple in bed; and "Bad Blood", accentuated by intense pyrotechnics. It is followed by the <b>acoustic set</b>, where Swift performs two surprise songs on guitar and piano. In an optical illusion, a body of water develops around the piano and envelops the stage; Swift then dives into the stage and appears to swim underwater, along the ramp and toward the main stage.</p>

<div><div><div><div>Swift performing "Lavender Haze" and "Vigilante Shit" during the <i>Midnights</i> act</div></div></div></div>

<p>The final act, <i><b>Midnights</b></i>, begins with a wave from the illusion crashing against the screen; Swift wakes up from a bed and climbs a ladder into a cloud. The lower screen splits, and dancers carry out clouds as Swift reemerges in a purple faux fur coat, a glittery oversized shirt and dark blue boots to sing "Lavender Haze". She removes the coat and performs "Anti-Hero" alongside a video of herself as a creature terrorizing a city. Dancers perform with umbrellas as Swift sings "Midnight Rain" and undergoes an onstage costume change, reappearing in a rhinestone-adorned midnight blue bodysuit. She then performs a "chair dance" choreographed for "Vigilante Shit", influenced by "sultry" burlesque and the 1975 musical <i>Chicago</i>. Swift follows with "Bejeweled", featuring moves inspired by the song's viral TikTok dance, and "Mastermind" with the entire dance crew wearing black robes. "Karma" is performed last, with Swift and dancers in tinsel-fringed jackets, closing the show with fireworks, colorful visuals, and confetti.</p>




<h2>Critical reception</h2>
<blockquote><p>It's easy to compare one of Swift's stadium shows to something you'd see on Broadway—never has that been more true than for The Eras Tour. The setlist is cut up into acts, grouped by eras for each of Swift's ten studio albums. For each era/act, Swift went full-send into that album's look, feel, costume, color blocking, and more.</p><div>—David Waiss Aramesh, "Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour Is a 3-Hour Career-Spanning Victory Lap", <i>Rolling Stone</i></div></blockquote>

<p>The tour received rave reviews from music and entertainment critics, who praised both the high-end spectacle and "polished artistry" of the tour. <i>Billboard</i> described the Eras Tour as "the must-see blockbuster of the year". Neil McCormick of <i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> Keiran Southern of <i>The Times,</i> Adrian Horton of <i>The Guardian</i>, Kelsey Barnes of <i>The Independent,</i> Ilana Kaplan of <i>i,</i> and Erica Campbell of <i>NME</i> gave the Eras Tour total five-star ratings. McCormick called the show "one of the most ambitious, spectacular, and charming stadium pop shows ever seen", lauding Swift's musicianship, vocals, and energy. Southern declared the Eras Tour "a pop genius at the top of her game". Horton praised the "rapturous" music selection, concept, "extravagant" staging, and Swift's stamina and vocals. Barnes noted the tour as "a career-defining spectacle" with acts marking the shifts in Swift's artistry, while Kaplan commended the "unparalleled" showmanship, "spicier" choreography, camp styles, and "seamless" transitions between acts. Campbell praised the storytelling aspect of the show that ties all the 10 acts together, enhanced by staging, cinematic ambience and fashion.</p>

<p>The versatility of the show's music, visuals, and performance art was often a point of praise in its reviews. Journalists Rebecca Lewis and Carson Mlnarik of <i>Hello!</i> and MTV, respectively, commended Swift's stage presence and commitment to her artistry; Lewis described Swift's alter egos during the tour as shifting from "country ingénue to pop princess and folklore witch", whereas Mlnarik affirmed that the on-screen visuals stayed true to every album's aesthetic. <i>The Week</i> and <i>Dallas Observer</i> critics agreed, highlighting the "jaw-dropping" visuals and "bedazzled" fashion. <i>Billboard</i> editor Jason Lipshutz underscored Swift's "powerhouse" vocals, engaging artistic personas, and skill set. Jon Caramanica of <i>The New York Times</i> highlighted the tour's scale, ambition, and portrayal of all the musical pivots of Swift's career, whereas <i>The Atlantic</i>'s Spencer Kornhaber complimented the show's art direction, suspense, and the sequencing of the acts. Mikael Wood of <i>Los Angeles Times</i> described the show as a "masterclass in pop ambition", showcasing Swift's range. According to <i>The New Yorker</i> senior editor Tyler Foggatt, the Eras Tour is a product of Swift's understanding of herself, building a tour "solely devoted to the idea of a trajectory—that of a career, of a musical identity, of a life—that can be traced cleanly from one <i>era</i> to the next."</p>

<p>Critics also appreciated the tour's production value and artistic direction. Philip Cosores of <i>Uproxx</i> dubbed it the "most impressive stadium show ever conceived". <i>Spin</i> critic Jonathan Cohen admired the rich stage design, usage of "state-of-the-art" technology, and immersive experience into Swift's "increasingly accomplished musical world-building". <i>Variety</i> journalist Chris Willman felt that the "epic" show demonstrated that "the person who has come up with the single greatest body of pop songwriting in the 21st century is also its most popular performer". <i>Pollstar</i>'s Christina Fuoco and Andy Gensler praised the production as "stunning and tastefully rendered" and "live music at its highest spectacle". <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s Waiss David Aramesh opined that it is "a production spectacle of the highest echelon". Melinda Sheckels of <i>Consequence</i> praised the tour's "nuanced and interpretive" approach in depicting Swift's albums and the "sheer magnitude, artistry, and technical prowess" of the production.</p>



<h2>Commercial performance</h2>

<h3>Boxscore</h3>
<p>The Eras Tour broke ticket sales records worldwide. In the first day of the US presale alone, the tour sold over 2.4 million tickets, the most sold by an artist in a single day, surpassing Robbie Williams, who had sold 1.6 million tickets for his Close Encounters Tour in 2005. <i>Billboard</i> reported on December 15 that the Eras Tour had already grossed an estimated US$554 million, and projected the US leg to finish with $591 million, surpassing the former all-time female record set by Madonna's Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour ($407 million) in 2008–2009. Following the tour's launch, Swift rose to number one on <i>Pollstar</i>'s Artist Power Index chart. MetLife Stadium named her their "#1 best-selling artist" of all time after the tour's third East Rutherford show, which was the 100th concert in the stadium's history.</p> 

<p><i>The Wall Street Journal</i> reported that the Eras Tour "on track to become the biggest in concert history, with the potential to gross over $1 billion"; conservative <i>Pollstar</i> estimates projected a $1.4 billion gross. Bloomberg News reported that the average gross per show on the US leg is $13 million. <i>Variety</i> claimed the tour had grossed $2 billion as of October 2023. According to <i>Forbes</i>, the Eras Tour has grossed $780 million from 56 shows as of August 2023, making it the highest-grossing tour by a woman in history, surpassing Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour, and the second highest-grossing tour of all time, behind Elton John's Farewell Yellow Brick Road.</p>

<h2>Accolades</h2>
<p>The Eras Tour won the touring category, Show of the Summer, at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards.</p>



<h2>Music releases</h2>
<div><div><div><div>Swift wore blue variants of her outfits for the <i>Speak Now</i>, <i>Folklore</i>, and <i>1989</i> acts to tease <i>1989 (Taylor's Version)</i>, her upcoming fourth re-recorded album, at the final show in Los Angeles's SoFi Stadium on August 9, 2023.</div></div></div></div>

<p>Swift unveiled various musical works during the tour. On the day of the opening show, she released four songs to celebrate the tour's launch: the re-recordings of "Eyes Open" and "Safe &amp; Sound", both originally from the 2012 soundtrack <i>The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond</i>; a re-recording of "If This Was a Movie", one of the deluxe tracks from <i>Speak Now</i> (2010); and "All of the Girls You Loved Before", a previously unreleased outtake of <i>Lover</i>.</p>

<p>A special CD edition of <i>Midnights</i>, subtitled <i>The Late Night Edition</i>, was released during the Eras Tour. It was only purchasable in-person at merchandise stands at certain shows, beginning in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on May 26, 2023. It exclusively contained the new bonus track "You're Losing Me", which became a "ravenously anticipated" song; <i>Variety</i> reported that "fans were so eager to get their hands" on the CD, causing queues at the stadium the day before the merchandise store opened.</p>

<p>On May 5, 2023, at the first Nashville show of the tour, Swift announced her third re-recorded album, <i>Speak Now (Taylor's Version),</i> and its release date as July 7, 2023. She also premiered two music videos, both of which she wrote and directed, during the tour. She premiered the videos for "Karma" featuring American rapper Ice Spice and "I Can See You" before the acoustic set at the first East Rutherford show and first Kansas City show, respectively.</p>

<p>On August 9, 2023, at the final Los Angeles show, Swift announced <i>1989 (Taylor's Version)</i> as her next re-recorded album, set for release on October 27, 2023, exactly nine years after the release of the original <i>1989</i> album.</p>



<h2>Film</h2>
<div>Main article: <i>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour</i></div>
<p>On October 13, 2023, Swift released the self-produced concert film, <i>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour</i>, directed by Sam Wrench, to theaters worldwide. It saw Swift, in an unprecedented move, partnering directly with the theaters to both distribute and exhibit the film instead of a major film studio. It became the highest-grossing concert film of all time.</p>



<h2>Impact</h2>
<div>Main article: Impact of the Eras Tour</div>

<div>

<blockquote>
<p>"Taylor Swift keeps building the legend of her Eras Tour, week after week, city by city, making every night so much longer, wilder, louder, more jubilant than it has to be. There's nothing in history to compare. This is her best tour ever, by an absurd margin. It's a journey through her past, starring all the different Taylors she's ever been, which means all the Taylors that you've ever been."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rob Sheffield,<i>Rolling Stone</i></p>
</div>
<p>The Eras Tour had an impact on the music industry, entertainment and beyond. It was described as one of the most prominent cultural phenomena of the 21st century, generating a level of attention similar to the 1960s' Beatlemania. The tour elevated the economy of its stops by revitalizing local businesses and tourism, attracted large crowds of spectators outside stadiums, dominated news cycles and social media, inspired tributes from governments and organizations, and fueled an increase in public consumption of her discography. Critics often described the Eras Tour as a monocultural event demonstrating Swift's impact on popular culture.</p>



<h2>Philanthropy</h2>
<p>Swift donated to food bank units at every stop of the Eras Tour, as reported by the respective organizations, and exclusively employed various local businesses to fulfill her crew's daily requirements. At the conclusion of the first US leg, Swift gave "unprecedented" bonus payments totaling over $55 million to her entire touring crew, including $100,000 to each of the 50 truck drivers involved in transporting the stage setup and production equipment. She also reportedly purchased more than double the carbon credits needed to offset emissions generated by her travel throughout the tour. In October 2023, Swift donated some Eras Tour tickets to the Rare Impact Fund—a charity and mental health awareness initiative by American singer Selena Gomez's cosmetic company, Rare Beauty. The auctioned tickets sold for $15,000 and were the "biggest ticket item of the event".</p>
