<div>American heavy metal band</div>
<div>This article is about the band. For its fifth album, see <i>Metallica</i> (album). For other uses, see Metallica (disambiguation).</div>



<p><b>Metallica</b> is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine, who formed Megadeth after being fired from Metallica, and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton, and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.</p>

<p>Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, <i>Master of Puppets</i> (1986), which is cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The band's next album, <i>...And Justice for All</i> (1988), gave Metallica its first Grammy Award nomination. Its fifth album, <i>Metallica</i> (1991), was a turning point for the band that saw them transition from their thrash roots; it appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling more than 16million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal roots with its ninth album, <i>Death Magnetic</i> (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums. The band's 11th and most recent album, <i>72 Seasons</i>, was released in 2023.</p>

<p>In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film <i>Metallica: Some Kind of Monster</i>, which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, <i>St. Anger</i> (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band co-wrote the screenplay for and starred alongside Dane DeHaan in the 2013 concert film <i>Metallica: Through the Never</i>, in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.</p>

<p>Metallica has released eleven studio albums, four live albums (including two performances with the San Francisco Symphony), twelve video albums, one cover album, two extended plays, thirty-seven singles and thirty-nine music videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from twenty-three nominations, and had six consecutive studio albums (from <i>Metallica</i> through <i>Hardwired... to Self-Destruct</i> (2016)) debut at number one on the <i>Billboard</i>200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold more than 125million albums worldwide as of 2018. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as <i>Rolling Stone</i>, which ranked the band in 61st place on its list of 100 greatest artists of all time. As of 2017, Metallica is the third-best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling 58million albums in the United States.</p>



<h2>History</h2>
<h3>1981–1984: Formation, early years, and <i>Kill 'Em All</i></h3>

<p>Metallica was formed in Los Angeles in late 1981 when Danish drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper, <i>The Recycler</i>, which read, "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden." Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album, <i>Metal Massacre</i>. Slagel accepted, and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar. The band was officially formed on October 28, 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.</p>

<p>The band name came from Ulrich's friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a fanzine and was considering <i>MetalMania</i> or <i>Metallica</i>. After hearing the two names, Ulrich wanted the latter for his band, so he suggested Quintana use <i>MetalMania</i> instead. Dave Mustaine replied to an advertisement for a lead guitarist; Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him after seeing his expensive guitar equipment. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song, "Hit the Lights", for the <i>Metal Massacre I</i> compilation. Hetfield sang and played both bass and rhythm guitar, while Lars Ulrich played drums and Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo. <i>Metal Massacre I</i> was released on June 14, 1982; early pressings listed the band incorrectly as "Mettallica", angering the band. The song generated word of mouth, and the band played its first live performance on March 14, 1982, at Radio City in Anaheim, California, with newly recruited bassist Ron McGovney. Their first live success came early; they were chosen to open for British heavy metal band Saxon at one gig of their 1982 U.S. tour. This was Metallica's second gig. Metallica recorded its first demo, <i>Power Metal</i>, whose name was inspired by Quintana's early business cards, in early 1982.</p>

<p>The term "thrash metal" was coined in February 1984 by <i>Kerrang!</i> journalist Malcolm Dome in reference to Anthrax's song "Metal Thrashing Mad". Prior to this, Hetfield referred to Metallica's sound as "power metal". In late 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub Whisky a Go Go, which featured bassist Cliff Burton in the band Trauma. The two were "blown away" by Burton's use of a wah-wah pedal and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney to leave because they thought he "didn't contribute anything, he just followed." Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year, he had accepted on the condition that the band move to El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the <i>Megaforce</i> demo (1983).</p>

<p>Metallica was ready to record their debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the cost, they began looking for other options. Concert promoter Jonathan "Jonny Z" Zazula, who had heard the demo <i>No Life 'til Leather</i> (1982), offered to broker a record deal between Metallica and New York City–based record labels. After those record labels showed no interest, Zazula borrowed enough money to cover the recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, Megaforce Records.</p>

<p>In May 1983, Metallica traveled to Rochester, New York, to record its debut album, <i>Metal Up Your Ass</i>, which was produced by Paul Curcio. The other members decided to eject Mustaine from the band because of his drug and alcohol abuse and violent behavior just before the recording sessions on April 11, 1983. Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett replaced Mustaine the same afternoon. Metallica's first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983, at a nightclub in Dover, New Jersey, called The Showplace; the support act was Anthrax's original lineup, which included Dan Lilker and Neil Turbin. This was the first time the two bands performed live together.</p>

<img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Kirk2010.jpg/180px-Kirk2010.jpg" height="271" width="180" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Kirk2010.jpg/270px-Kirk2010.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Kirk2010.jpg/360px-Kirk2010.jpg 2x" />Kirk Hammett (pictured in 2010) replaced Mustaine in 1983, and has been with the band ever since.
<p>Mustaine, who went on to form Megadeth, has expressed his dislike for Hammett in interviews, saying Hammett "stole" his job. Mustaine was "pissed off" because he believes Hammett became popular by playing guitar leads that Mustaine had actually written. In a 1985 interview with <i>Metal Forces</i>, Mustaine said, "It's real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that <i>No Life 'til Leather</i> tape and got voted No.1 guitarist in your magazine." On Megadeth's debut album, <i>Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!</i> (1985), Mustaine included the song "Mechanix", which Metallica had previously reworked and retitled "The Four Horsemen" on <i>Kill 'Em All</i>. Mustaine said he did this to "straighten Metallica up" because Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar.</p>

<p>Because of conflicts with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album titled <i>Metal Up Your Ass</i>, the album was renamed <i>Kill 'Em All</i>. It was released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and on Music for Nations in Europe, and peaked at number 155 on the <i>Billboard</i>200 in 1986. Although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal scene. To support the release, Metallica embarked on the Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven. In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, during which the bands performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.</p>

<h3>1984–1986: <i>Ride the Lightning</i>, <i>Master of Puppets</i>, and Burton's death</h3>
<img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Bass_burton.jpg/220px-Bass_burton.jpg" height="170" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Bass_burton.jpg/330px-Bass_burton.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Bass_burton.jpg 2x" />Cliff Burton (pictured in 1985) replaced Ron McGovney as the bassist in 1982 and played with the band until his death in 1986.
<p>Metallica recorded its second studio album, <i>Ride the Lightning</i>, at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark, from February to March 1984. It was released in August 1984 and reached number 100 on the <i>Billboard</i>200. A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors' items. Mustaine received writing credit for "Ride the Lightning" and "The Call of Ktulu".</p>

<p>Elektra Records A&amp;R director Michael Alago and co-founder of Q-Prime Management Cliff Burnstein attended a Metallica concert in September 1984; they were impressed with the performance, signed Metallica to Elektra and made the band a client of Q-Prime Management. Metallica's growing success was such that the band's British label, Music for Nations, released "Creeping Death" as a limited-edition single, which sold 40,000 copies as an import in the U.S. Two of the three songs on the record – cover versions of Diamond Head's "Am I Evil?" and Blitzkrieg's "Blitzkrieg" – appeared on the 1988 Elektra reissue of <i>Kill 'Em All</i>. Metallica embarked on its first major European tour with Tank to an average crowd of 1,300. Returning to the U.S., it embarked on a co-headlining tour with W.A.S.P. and support from Armored Saint. Metallica played its largest show at the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park, England, on August 17, 1985, with Bon Jovi and Ratt, playing to 70,000 people. At a show in Oakland, California, at the Day on the Green festival, the band played to a crowd of 60,000.</p>

<p>Metallica's third studio album, <i>Master of Puppets</i>, was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios from September to December 1985 and released in March 1986. The album reached number 29 on the <i>Billboard</i>200 and spent 72 weeks on the chart. It was the band's first album to be certified Gold on November 4, 1986, and was certified six times Platinum in 2003. Steve Huey of AllMusic considered the album "the band's greatest achievement". Following the release of the album, Metallica supported Ozzy Osbourne on a U.S. tour. Hetfield broke his wrist while skateboarding; he continued with the tour, performing vocals, with guitar technician John Marshall playing rhythm guitar.</p>

<p>On September 27, 1986, during the European leg of Metallica's Damage, Inc. Tour, members drew cards to determine which bunks on the tour bus they would sleep in. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett's bunk. At around sunrise near Dörarp, Sweden, the bus driver lost control and skidded, which caused the bus to overturn several times. Ulrich, Hammett and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, Burton was pinned under the bus and died. Hetfield said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, "Don't fucking do that!" I already wanted to kill the [bus driver]. I don't know if he was drunk or if he hit some ice. All I knew was, he was driving and Cliff wasn't alive anymore.</p></blockquote>

<h3>1986–1994: Newsted joins, <i>...And Justice for All</i> and <i>Metallica</i></h3>
<img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/13-06-09_RaR_Newsted_13.jpg/180px-13-06-09_RaR_Newsted_13.jpg" height="250" width="180" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/13-06-09_RaR_Newsted_13.jpg/270px-13-06-09_RaR_Newsted_13.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/13-06-09_RaR_Newsted_13.jpg/360px-13-06-09_RaR_Newsted_13.jpg 2x" />Jason Newsted (pictured in 2013) joined Metallica soon after Cliff Burton's death in 1986.
<p>Burton's death left Metallica's future in doubt. The three remaining members decided Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings, the band sought a replacement. Roughly 40 people – including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus; Troy Gregory of Prong; and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam – auditioned for the band to fill Burton's spot. Newsted learned Metallica's entire setlist; after the audition, Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; his first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi. The band finished its tour in February 1987.</p>

<p>After Newsted joined Metallica, the band left their El Cerrito practice space – a suburban house formerly rented by sound engineer Mark Whitaker and dubbed "the Metalli-mansion" – and relocated to the adjacent cities of Berkeley and Albany before eventually settling in the Marin County city of San Rafael, north of San Francisco. In March 1987, Hetfield again broke his wrist while skateboarding, forcing the band to cancel an appearance on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. In August 1987, an all-covers extended play (EP), titled <i>The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited</i>, was released. The EP was recorded in an effort to use the band's newly constructed recording studio, test Newsted's talents, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled <i>Cliff 'Em All</i> commemorating Burton's three years in Metallica was released in 1987; the video included bass solos, home videos and pictures.</p>

<p>Metallica's first studio album since Burton's death, <i>...And Justice for All</i>, was recorded from January to May 1988 and released in September. The album was a commercial success, reaching number 6 on the <i>Billboard</i>200, and was the band's first album to enter the top 10. The album was certified Platinum nine weeks after its release. There were complaints about the production, however; Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ulrich's drums were clicking more than thudding, and the guitars "buzz thinly". To promote the album, Metallica embarked on a tour called Damaged Justice.</p>

<p>In 1989, Metallica received its first Grammy Award nomination for <i>...And Justice for All</i> in the new Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrument category. Metallica was the favorite to win, but the award was given to Jethro Tull for the album <i>Crest of a Knave</i>. The award was controversial with fans and the press; Metallica was standing off-stage waiting to receive the award after performing the song "One". Jethro Tull had been advised by its manager not to attend the ceremony because he was expecting Metallica to win. The award was named in <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>'s "Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets" list.</p>

<p>Following the release of <i>...And Justice for All</i>, Metallica released its debut music video for the song "One", which the band performed in an abandoned warehouse. The footage was remixed with the film <i>Johnny Got His Gun</i>. Rather than organize an ongoing licensing deal, Metallica purchased the rights to the film. The remixed video was submitted to MTV with an alternative, performance-only version that was held back in case MTV banned the remixed version. MTV accepted the remixed version; the video was viewers' first exposure to Metallica. In 1999, it was voted number 38 in MTV's "Top 100 Videos of All Time" countdown and was featured on the network's 25th-anniversary edition of <i>ADD Video</i>, which showcased the most popular videos on MTV in the last 25 years.</p>

<p>In October 1990, Metallica entered One on One Recording's studio in North Hollywood to record its next album. Bob Rock, who had worked with Aerosmith, The Cult, Bon Jovi and Mötley Crüe, was hired as the producer. <i>Metallica</i> – also known as <i>The Black Album</i> – was remixed three times, cost US$1million, and ended Hammett and Ulrich's marriages. Although the release was delayed until 1991, <i>Metallica</i> debuted at number one in 10 countries, selling 650,000 units in the U.S. during its first week. The album brought Metallica mainstream attention; it has been certified 16 times Platinum in the U.S., which makes it the 25th-best-selling album in the country. The making of <i>Metallica</i> and the following tour was documented in <i>A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica</i>. The tour in support of the album, called the Wherever We May Roam Tour, lasted 14 months and included dates in the U.S., Japan and the U.K. In September 1991, 1.6million rock music fans converged in Moscow to enjoy the first open-air rock concert to be held in the former Soviet Union; it was part of the Monsters of Rock series. However, in a June 2020 interview, Lars estimated the attendance at about a halfmillion during their time slot. In April 1992, Metallica appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and performed a three-song set. Hetfield later performed "Stone Cold Crazy" with the remaining members of Queen and Tony Iommi.</p>

<p>On August 8, 1992, during the co-headlining Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Hetfield suffered second- and third-degree burns to his arms, face, hands and legs. There had been some confusion with the new pyrotechnics setup, which resulted in Hetfield walking into a 12-foot (3.7m) flame during "Fade to Black". Newsted said Hetfield's skin was "bubbling like on <i>The Toxic Avenger</i>". Metallica returned to the stage 17 days later with guitar technician and Metal Church member John Marshall replacing Hetfield on guitar for the remainder of the tour, although Hetfield was able to sing. Later in 1993, Metallica went on the Nowhere Else to Roam Tour, playing five shows in Mexico City. <i>Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge</i>, the band's first box set, was released in November 1993. The collection contains three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters.</p>

<h3>1994–2001: <i>Load</i>, <i>Reload</i>, Napster controversy and Newsted's departure</h3>
<img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/James_Hetfield_-_Cardiff_1996.jpg/220px-James_Hetfield_-_Cardiff_1996.jpg" height="129" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/James_Hetfield_-_Cardiff_1996.jpg/330px-James_Hetfield_-_Cardiff_1996.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/James_Hetfield_-_Cardiff_1996.jpg/440px-James_Hetfield_-_Cardiff_1996.jpg 2x" />James Hetfield performing with the band during its tour for <i>Load</i> in 1996
<p>After almost three years of touring to promote <i>Metallica</i>, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, which comprised three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy? and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of <i>Load</i> in 1996. <i>Load</i> debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i>200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number one album. The cover art, <i>Blood and Semen III</i>, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked another change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the band members' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996.</p>

<p>During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album, titled <i>Reload</i>. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. <i>Reload</i>, too, debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i>200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film <i>Metallica: Some Kind of Monster</i> that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were "polished and reworked" until judged releasable. To promote <i>Reload</i>, Metallica performed "Fuel" and "The Memory Remains" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's <i>Saturday Night Live</i> in December 1997.</p>

<p>In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, titled <i>Garage Inc.</i> The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy, Mercyful Fate, Black Sabbath and others, and the second disc featured the original version of <i>The $5.98 E.P. – Garage Days Re-Revisited</i>, which had become a scarce collectors' item. The album entered the <i>Billboard</i>200 at number two.</p>

<p>On April 21 and 22, 1999, Metallica recorded two performances with the San Francisco Symphony, which was conducted by Michael Kamen, who had previously worked with producer Rock on "Nothing Else Matters". Kamen approached Metallica in 1991 with the idea of pairing the band's music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event: "No Leaf Clover" and "-Human". The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film <i>S&amp;M</i>. It entered the <i>Billboard</i>200 at number two and the Australian ARIA charts and Top Internet Albums chart at number one.</p>

<p>In 2000, Metallica discovered that a demo of its song "I Disappear", which was supposed to be released in combination with the <i>Mission: Impossible II</i> soundtrack, was receiving radio airplay. Tracing the source of the leak, the band found the file on the Napster peer-to-peer file-sharing network and also found that the band's entire catalogue was freely available. Metallica filed a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, alleging that Napster violated three areas of the law: copyright infringement, unlawful use of digital audio interface device and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).</p>

<img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Lars_Ulrich_The_Rock_Copenhagen.JPG/180px-Lars_Ulrich_The_Rock_Copenhagen.JPG" height="228" width="180" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Lars_Ulrich_The_Rock_Copenhagen.JPG/270px-Lars_Ulrich_The_Rock_Copenhagen.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Lars_Ulrich_The_Rock_Copenhagen.JPG/360px-Lars_Ulrich_The_Rock_Copenhagen.JPG 2x" />Lars Ulrich led the case against Napster for Metallica.
<p>Ulrich provided a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000. Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down. A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared. On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets, according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.</p>

<p>At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich appeared with host Marlon Wayans in a skit that criticized the idea of using Napster to share music. Wayans played a college student listening to Metallica's "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation, and he responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just "sharing" by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was "borrowing things that were not yours without asking." He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt that read: "I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own." Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.</p>

<p>Newsted left Metallica on January 17, 2001, just as plans were being made to enter the recording studio. He said he left the band for "private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love." During a <i>Playboy</i> interview with Metallica, Newsted said he wanted to release an album with his side project, Echobrain. Hetfield was opposed to the idea and said, "When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica" and that a side project is "like cheating on your wife in a way." Newsted said Hetfield had recorded vocals for a song used in the film <i>South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut</i>, and appeared on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied: "My name isn't on those records. And I'm not out trying to sell them" and raised questions such as, "Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?"</p>

<h3>2001–2006: <i>Some Kind of Monster</i>, <i>St. Anger</i>, and Trujillo joins</h3>
<p>In April 2001, filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky began following Metallica to document the recording process of the band's next studio album. Over two years they recorded more than 1,000 hours of footage. On July 19, 2001, before preparations to enter the recording studio, Hetfield entered rehab to treat his "alcoholism and other addictions". All recording plans were put on hold and the band's future was in doubt. Hetfield left rehab on December 4, 2001, and the band returned to the recording studio on April 12, 2002. Hetfield was required to limit his work to four hours a day between noon and 4pm, and to spend the rest of his time with his family. The footage recorded by Berlinger and Sinofsky was compiled into the documentary <i>Metallica: Some Kind of Monster</i>, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. In the documentary, Newsted said his former bandmates' decision to hire a therapist to help solve their problems which he felt they could have solved on their own was "really fucking lame and weak".</p>

<p>In June 2003, Metallica's eighth studio album, <i>St. Anger</i>, debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i>200, and drew mixed reactions from critics. Ulrich's "steely" sounding snare drum and the absence of guitar solos received particular criticism. Kevin Forest Moreau of <i>Shakingthrough.net</i> said, "the guitars stumble in a monotone of mid-level, processed rattle; the drums don't propel as much as struggle to disguise an all-too-turgid pace; and the rage is both unfocused and leavened with too much narcissistic navel-gazing". Brent DiCrescenzo of <i>Pitchfork</i> described it as "an utter mess". However, <i>Blender</i> magazine called it the "grimiest and grimmest of the band's Bob Rock productions", and <i>New York Magazine</i> called it "utterly raw and rocking". The title track, "St. Anger", won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2004; it was used as the official theme song for WWE's <i>SummerSlam 2003</i>.</p>

<p>For the duration of <i>St. Anger</i>'s recording period, producer Bob Rock played bass on the album and in several live shows at which Metallica performed during that time. Once the record was completed, the band started to hold auditions for Newsted's permanent replacement. Bassists Pepper Keenan, Jeordie White, Scott Reeder, Eric Avery, Danny Lohner, and Chris Wyse—among others—auditioned for the role. After three months of auditions, Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne's band, was chosen as the new bassist. Newsted, who had joined Canadian thrash metal band Voivod by that time, was Trujillo's replacement in Osbourne's band during the 2003 Ozzfest tour, which included Voivod.</p>

<p>Before the band's set at the 2004 Download Festival, Ulrich was rushed to the hospital after having an anxiety seizure and was unable to perform. Hetfield searched for last-minute volunteers to replace Ulrich. Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered. Lombardo performed "Battery" and "The Four Horsemen", Ulrich's drum technician Flemming Larsen performed "Fade to Black", and Jordison performed the remainder of the set. Having toured for two years in support of <i>St. Anger</i> on the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 and the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, with multi-platinum rock band Godsmack in support, Metallica took a break from performing and spent most of 2005 with friends and family. The band opened for The Rolling Stones at SBC Park in San Francisco on November 13 and 15, 2005.</p>

<h3>2006–2013: <i>Death Magnetic</i> and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction</h3>
<p>In February 2006, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing the band's next studio album. Instead, the band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin. Around the same time, a petition signed by 1,500 fans was posted online in an attempt to encourage the band to prohibit Rock from producing Metallica albums, saying he had too much influence on the band's sound and musical direction. Rock said the petition hurt his children's feelings; he said, "sometimes, even with a great coach, a team keeps losing. You have to get new blood in there."</p>

<p>In December 2006, Metallica released a DVD titled <i>The Videos 1989–2004</i>, which sold 28,000 copies in its first week and entered the <i>Billboard</i> Top Videos chart at number three. Metallica recorded a guitar-based interpretation of Ennio Morricone's "The Ecstasy of Gold" for a tribute album titled <i>We All Love Ennio Morricone</i>, which was released in February 2007. The track received a Grammy nomination at the 50th Grammy Awards for the category "Best Rock Instrumental Performance". A recording of "The Ecstasy of Gold" has been played to introduce Metallica's performances since the 1980s.</p>

<p>Metallica scheduled the release of the album <i>Death Magnetic</i> as September 12, 2008, and the band filmed a music video for the album's first single, "The Day That Never Comes". On September 2, 2008, a record store in France began selling copies of <i>Death Magnetic</i> nearly two weeks before its scheduled worldwide release date, which resulted in the album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor Vertigo Records to officially release the album on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking legal action against the French retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich responded to the leak by saying, "...We're ten days from release. I mean, from here, we're golden. If this thing leaks all over the world today or tomorrow, happy days. Happy days. Trust me", and, "By 2008 standards, that's a victory. If you'd told me six months ago that our record wouldn't leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that."</p>

<p><i>Death Magnetic</i> debuted at number one in the U.S., selling 490,000 units; Metallica became the first band to have five consecutive studio albums debut at number one in the history of the <i>Billboard</i>200. A week after its release, <i>Death Magnetic</i> remained at number one on the <i>Billboard</i>200 and the European album chart; it also became the fastest selling album of 2008 in Australia. <i>Death Magnetic</i> remained at number one on the <i>Billboard</i>200 album chart for three consecutive weeks. Metallica was one of two artists whose album—the other being Jack Johnson's album <i>Sleep Through the Static</i>—remained on the <i>Billboard</i>200 for three consecutive weeks at number one in 2008. <i>Death Magnetic</i> also remained at number one on <i>Billboard</i>'s Hard Rock, Modern Rock/Alternative and Rock album charts for five consecutive weeks. The album reached number one in 32 countries outside the U.S., including the UK, Canada, and Australia. In November 2008, Metallica's record deal with Warner Bros. ended and the band considered releasing its next album through the internet.</p>

<p>On January 14, 2009, it was announced that Metallica would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 4, 2009, and that former bassist Jason Newsted—who left the band in 2001—would perform with the band at the ceremony. Initially, it was announced that the matter had been discussed and that bassist Trujillo had agreed not to play because he "wanted to see the Black Album band". However, during the band's set of "Master of Puppets" and "Enter Sandman", both Trujillo and Newsted were on stage. Ray Burton, father of the late Cliff Burton, accepted the honor on his behalf. Although he was not to be inducted with them, Metallica invited Dave Mustaine to take part in the induction ceremony. Mustaine declined because of his touring commitments in Europe.</p>

<p>In a June 2009 interview with Italy's Rock TV, Ulrich said Metallica was planning to continue touring until August 2010, and that there were no plans for a tenth album. He said he was sure the band would collaborate with producer Rick Rubin again. According to Blabbermouth.net, the band was considering recording its next album in the second half of 2011. In November 2010, during an interview with The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs."</p>

There's no shortage of riffage in Metallica world right now." He added, "The first album with Rick was also the first album for me, so in a lot of ways, you're kind of testing the water. Now that we're comfortable with Rick and his incredible engineer, Greg Fidelman, who worked with Slayer, actually, on this last record—it's my hero—it's a great team. And it's only gonna better; I really believe that. So I'm super-excited." In June 2011, Rubin said Metallica had begun writing its new album.</p>

<p>In April 2016, during the week leading up to Record Store Day, for which the band was its ambassador for 2016, Ulrich told <i>Billboard</i> that the band's expanded role within the music industry had played a part in the amount of time that it had taken to write and record the album. "The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of <i>Kill 'Em All</i> and <i>Ride the Lightning</i>. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. "Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016".

<p>In an interview with Australian magazine <i>The Music</i>'s official podcast in March 2019, Trujillo said that Metallica had begun jamming on new material for its next studio album. "I'm excited about the next record because I believe it will also be a culmination of the two [previous] records and another journey. There's no shortage of original ideas, that's the beauty of being in this band." He estimated that the album would be released "a lot sooner than the previous two did... this time around I think we'll be able to jump on it a lot quicker and jump in the studio and start working. We've all vowed to get this one going sooner than later." In an interview with Australian magazine <i>Mixdown</i> the following month, Hammett said that the band had tentative plans to enter the studio after the conclusion of its WorldWired Tour. He stated, "We're in our third year since <i>Hardwired</i>. Maybe we can get a bit more focus and go into the studio a bit sooner." After not contributing any writing to <i>Hardwired... to Self-Destruct</i>, Hammett said regarding his ideas for the new album, "I have a ton of material. I've over-compensated, so I'm ready to go anytime."</p>

<p>In March 2019, Metallica announced that its WorldWired Tour would continue into Australia and New Zealand in October with Slipknot in support. Later that month, the band announced that it would perform at the grand opening of San Francisco's new Chase Center with the San Francisco Symphony in September to celebrate the twenty-year anniversary of <i>S&amp;M</i>. The commemorative shows, titled <i>S&amp;M2</i>, were screened in more than 3,000 theaters worldwide on October 9; the event featured arrangements from the original <i>S&amp;M</i> concerts as well as new arrangements for songs recorded since then and a cover of the Alexander Mosolov piece <i>Iron Foundry</i>, and were conducted by Edwin Outwater and San Francisco Symphony music director Michael Tilson Thomas. <i>S&amp;M2</i> went on to earn $5.5million at the box office, making it the biggest global rock event cinema release of all time; a second screening was later announced for October 30 as a result. In August 2020, the band announced that they would release the <i>S&amp;M2</i> performances as an album, DVD and box set.</p>

<p>In July 2019, Metallica announced a set of South American tour dates for April 2020 with Greta Van Fleet in support. In September, ahead of that year's Global Citizen Festival, it was announced that Metallica would perform at the following year's festival in September 2020 alongside artists such as Billie Eilish, Miley Cyrus and Coldplay, in what would be the final event of Global Poverty Project's year-long Global Goal Live: The Possible Dream campaign. The following day, on September 27, Metallica announced that Hetfield had re-entered a rehabilitation program and that its Australia/New Zealand tour would be postponed. In a statement by Ulrich, Hammett and Trujillo, the band spoke of the devastation of the news, saying that Hetfield "[had] been struggling with addiction on and off for many years" and that all tickets would be fully refunded. Ulrich later added that Hetfield was "in the process of healing himself", and that the band hoped to return to Australia and New Zealand in 2020. The band's other commitments, including a benefit concert in March 2020, were still expected to continue as planned; a further five US festival appearances were announced in October. These shows were later postponed or cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to support Hetfield's recovery.</p>

<p>In March 2020, the band began a series on YouTube and Facebook called <i>#MetallicaMondays</i>, where they streamed full archived shows every Monday to relieve boredom while staying home and social distancing amid the pandemic. In May 2020, while in quarantine, Metallica performed a virtual acoustic version of "Blackened", titled "Blackened 2020", which was later made available for download.</p>

<p>In an interview with Marc Benioff in April 2020, Ulrich stated that Metallica could work on its next studio album while in quarantine. Trujillo told <i>The Vinyl Guide</i> in June that the band was "excited about cultivating new ideas" for its new album. "We communicate every week, which is really great, so we have our connection intact [...] what we've started doing is basically just really concentrating on our home studios and being creative from our homes and navigating through ideas and building on new ideas. And that's where we're at right now". He also said that the band was working towards eventually entering a studio to record the album.</p>

<p>On August 10, 2020, Metallica played a show at Gundlach-Bundschu Winery in Sonoma, California, which was only attended by a few crew members, and it was recorded and played for drive-in movies across the U.S. and Canada on August 29.</p>

<p>In May 2021, the band announced that they would do one more <i>#MetallicaMondays</i> on May 24 to benefit their All Within My Hands Foundation. The concert dates to September 6, 2018, in Lincoln, Nebraska. On Labor Day, September 6, 2021, the band's All Within My Hands Foundation raised $377,450. Metallica teamed up with workwear brand Carhartt on the initiative, with the clothing brand donating all of their sales proceeds on the holiday to the band's Metallica Scholars initiative, which provides opportunities to people interested in pursuing essential workforce jobs.</p>

<p>Metallica's sound has been described as heavy metal, thrash metal, speed metal, and hard rock. Metallica was influenced by early heavy metal and hard rock bands and artists Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Ted Nugent, AC/DC, Rush, Aerosmith, and Judas Priest and by new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) bands Raven, Venom, Motörhead, Saxon, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, and Iron Maiden as well as European bands Scorpions, Accept, and Mercyful Fate. Early punk rock bands Ramones, Sex Pistols, and the Misfits also influenced Metallica's style as did post-punk band Killing Joke and hardcore punk acts Discharge, GBH, and Suicidal Tendencies. Lars Ulrich has cited Iron Maiden as probably the biggest influence on Metallica's career. The band's early releases contained fast tempos, harmonized leads, and nine-minute instrumental tracks. Steve Huey of AllMusic said <i>Ride the Lightning</i> featured "extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers". He also said Metallica expanded its compositional technique and range of expression to take on a more aggressive approach in following releases, and lyrics dealt with personal and socially conscious issues. Religious and military leaders, rage, insanity, monsters, and drugs—among other themes—were explored on <i>Master of Puppets</i>.</p>

<p>In 1991, Huey said Metallica with new producer Bob Rock simplified and streamlined its music for a more commercial approach to appeal to mainstream audiences. Robert Palmer of <i>Rolling Stone</i> said the band abandoned its aggressive, fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range. The change in direction proved commercially successful; <i>Metallica</i> was the band's first album to peak at number one on the <i>Billboard</i>200. Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the grunge movement of the early-1990s. In <i>Load</i>—an album that has been described as having "an almost alternative rock" approach—the band changed musical direction again and focused on non-metal influences. Metallica's new lyrical approach moved away from drugs and monsters, and focused on anger, loss, and retribution. Some fans and critics were not pleased with this change, which included haircuts, the cover art of <i>Load</i>, and headlining the Lollapalooza festival of 1996. David Fricke of <i>Rolling Stone</i> described the move as "goodbye to the moldy stricture and dead-end Puritanism of no-frills thrash", and called <i>Load</i> the heaviest record of 1996. With the release of <i>ReLoad</i> in 1997, the band displayed blues and early hard rock influences, incorporating more rhythm and harmony in song structures.</p>

<p><i>St. Anger</i> marked another large change in the band's sound. Guitar solos were excluded from the album, leaving a "raw and unpolished sound". The band used drop C tuning; Ulrich's snare drum received particular criticism. <i>New York Magazine</i>'s Ethan Brown said it "reverberates with a thwong". The album's lyrics deal with Hetfield's drug rehabilitation and include references to the devil, anti-drug themes, claustrophobia, impending doom, and religious hypocrisy. At the advice of producer Rick Rubin, for its ninth studio album <i>Death Magnetic</i>, the band returned to standard tuning and guitar solos. As a return to Metallica's thrash roots, <i>Death Magnetic</i> was a riff-oriented album featuring intense guitar solos and subtle lyrics about suicide and redemption.</p>



<h2>All Within My Hands Foundation</h2>
<p>In February 2017, Metallica launched All Within My Hands Foundation, "dedicated to creating sustainable communities by supporting workforce education, the fight against hunger, and other critical local services". For example, the group works with various selected charities to organize volunteer projects at food banks. It also works with workforce training institutions on its Metallica Scholars grant program to help chosen students learn new trade skills. The Foundation has also donated and further raised funds for World Central Kitchen's Ukraine war relief efforts and granted $200,000 for relief efforts after the destructive August 2023 Maui, Hawaii fire. The band has also performed fundraising concerts for the Foundation.</p>



<h2>Legacy and influence</h2>
<p>Metallica has become one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time and is credited as one of the "big four" of thrash metal, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth. The band has sold more than 125million records worldwide, including an RIAA-certified 66million and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 58,000,000 in the US, making Metallica one of the most commercially successful bands of all time. The writers of <i>The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll</i> said Metallica gave heavy metal "a much-needed charge". Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica "expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions", and called the band "easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth".</p>

<p>Jonathan Davis of Korn said he respects Metallica as his favorite band; he said, "I love that they've done things their own way and they've persevered over the years and they're still relevant to this day. I think they're one of the greatest bands ever." Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest influence on the band, stating, "they really changed my life when I was 16 years old—I'd never heard anything that heavy". Chuck Billy of Testament has also cited Metallica as an influence on the band, as well as Hetfield as "an inspiration with clever lyrics"; he added, "When I first started hearing Metallica it was something new to me the way his cadence of vocal styles sang to the music." Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, <i>The Blackening</i>, "What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album <i>Master of Puppets</i>—and the staying power—a timeless record like that". Gojira lead guitarist Christian Andreu said it was while listening to <i>Ride the Lightning</i> that he started making music; saying "we find on the album 'Fade to Black', 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', emblematic pieces". Trivium guitarists Corey Beaulieu and Matt Heafy said that when they heard Metallica they wanted to start playing guitar. M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, "Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols <i>Metallica</i>". God Forbid guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton as a "rocker". Ill Niño drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica releases are "heavy, raw, rebellious. It said, 'fuck you'", and Adema drummer Kris Kohls said the band is influenced by Metallica.</p>

<p>On April 4, 2009, Metallica were inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. They entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the second year they were eligible and first year they were nominated. Metallica's induction into the Hall included its current lineup, James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Robert Trujillo, and Lars Ulrich, and former members Jason Newsted and Cliff Burton.</p>

Metallica was ranked 42nd on VH1's "100 Greatest Artists of All Time", was listed fifth on VH1's "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock", and the band was number one on VH1's "20 Greatest Metal Bands" list. <i>Rolling Stone</i> placed the band 61st on its list of "The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time"; its albums <i>Master of Puppets</i> and <i>Metallica</i> were ranked at numbers 167 and 252 respectively on the magazine's list of <i>The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</i>. <i>Master of Puppets</i> was named in <i>Q Magazine</i>'s "50 Heaviest Albums of All Time", and was ranked number one on IGN's "Top 25 Metal Albums", and number one on Metal-rules.com's "Top 100 Heavy Metal Albums" list. "Enter Sandman" was ranked number 399 on <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".</p>

<p><i>Kerrang!</i> released a tribute album titled <i>Master of Puppets: Remastered</i> with the April 8, 2006, edition of the magazine to celebrate the 20th anniversary of <i>Master of Puppets</i>. The album featured cover versions of Metallica songs by Machine Head, Bullet for My Valentine, Chimaira, Mastodon, Mendeed, and Trivium—all of which are influenced by Metallica. At least 15 Metallica tribute albums have been released. On September 10, 2006, Metallica guest starred on <i>The Simpsons</i>' eighteenth-season premiere, "The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer".

Finnish cello metal band Apocalyptica released a tribute album titled <i>Plays Metallica by Four Cellos</i>, which features eight Metallica songs played on cellos. A parody band named Beatallica plays music using a combination of The Beatles and Metallica songs. Beatallica faced legal troubles when Sony, which owns The Beatles' catalog, issued a cease and desist order, claiming "substantial and irreparable injury" and ordering the group to pay damages. Ulrich, a fan of Beatallica, asked Metallica's lawyer Peter Paterno to help settle the case.</p>

<p>On March 7, 1999, Metallica was inducted into the San Francisco Walk of Fame. The mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown, proclaimed the day "Official Metallica Day".
