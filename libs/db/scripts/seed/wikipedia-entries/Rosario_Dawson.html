I didn't do that, ... I mean, it's not inaccurate, but I never did come out. I mean, I guess I am now ... I've never had a relationship in that space, so it's never felt like an authentic calling to me." A representative of Dawson later clarified to <i>The Daily Beast</i> that she meant to say she came out as an ally of the LGBTQ community.</p>
