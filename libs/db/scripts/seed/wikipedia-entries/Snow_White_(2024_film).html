<p><i><b>Snow White</b></i> is an upcoming American musical fantasy film directed by Marc Webb, from a screenplay by Greta Gerwig and Erin Cressida Wilson. Co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Marc Platt Productions, it is a live-action remake of Walt Disney's 1937 animated feature film <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i>, which itself is loosely based on the 1812 fairy tale of the same title by the Brothers Grimm. The film stars Rachel Zegler as the title character and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen.</p>

<p>Plans for a remake of 1937's <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i> were confirmed in October 2016, with Wilson announced as a screenwriter. Webb entered talks to direct the film in May 2019 and joined the film as director in September 2019. Filming took place primarily at Pinewood Studios, England from March to July of 2022. The film elicited pre-release controversies pre-marketing, with criticism levied against Zegler's outspokenness during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strikes, story changes and color-blind casting, as well as non-dwarf actors playing originally dwarf characters. </p>

<p><i>Snow White</i> is scheduled to be released theatrically in the United States on March 22, 2024.</p>

<p>On October 31, 2016, Variety reported that Walt Disney Pictures was developing a live-action remake of <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i>, with Erin Cressida Wilson being in talks to write the screenplay. On May 30, 2019, it was reported that Marc Webb was in talks to direct the film. In November 2021, Greta Gerwig was reported to be co-writing the screenplay.  Gurinder Chadha was also heavily considered for the job.</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<p>In June 2021, Rachel Zegler was cast in the titular role, and in November, Gal Gadot was cast as the Evil Queen. On December 7, 2021, during an interview with ExtraTV, Rachel Zegler revealed that Snow White would be a lot "stronger" than the original. A new casting search was announced for a young actress to star as a younger version of Snow White in the live-action remake. On January 12, 2022, it was announced that Andrew Burnap was cast as a new character named Jonathan in the lead male role, replacing the character of The Prince. At the 2022 Denver Fan Expo, Martin Klebba revealed that he would be portraying Grumpy in the film; Klebba previously played similar dwarf roles in prior productions based on the "Snow White" fairy tale: in the 2001 made-for-television film <i>Snow White: The Fairest of Them All</i> as Friday, and in the 2012 fantasy comedy <i>Mirror Mirror</i> as Butcher.</p>

<p>In August 2023, it was revealed that another Latina actress named Renata Vaca was one of two finalists in the casting process for the role of Snow White, the other being Zegler who ultimately won the role. Vaca, a Mexican national, stated that the casting call for the role of Snow White was "open to all ethnic groups", and that the first phase of auditioning consisted of singing a Disney Princess song. Vaca went on to be cast in the American horror sequel <i>Saw X</i>.</p>

<h3>Filming</h3>
<p>Filming for <i>Snow White</i> was originally set to begin in March 2020 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2021, it was announced that filming would take place in the United Kingdom from March to July 2022. Principal photography began on March 7, 2022. A fire damaged the production set on March 15 at Pinewood Studios; the stage was under construction when a tree reportedly caught on fire, leading to a huge blaze. A source from Disney confirmed that "no filming was underway". The shooting schedule was also reconfigured in order for Zegler to travel to Los Angeles to present at the 94th Academy Awards ceremony on March 27, in support of her <i>West Side Story</i> colleagues. While Zegler was attending the ceremony, Gadot began filming her scenes. During a podcast interview with <i>Forbes</i>, Gadot revealed that she sings and dances in the film. On April 22, Gadot confirmed that she had completed filming her scenes, much later adding that playing the role of the first Disney villain ever was "fun and delicious", feeling that she was able to make a more dramatic role by changing her voice due to the film being a musical. On July 13, Zegler revealed that filming had wrapped.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>Songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who previously wrote the lyrics for two new songs for Disney's 2019 remake of <i>Aladdin</i>, are set to write new songs for the film, which is expected to also feature songs from the original film by Frank Churchill and Larry Morey, including "Whistle While You Work," which was confirmed by Zegler.</p>



<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>On September 9, 2022, during Disney's 2022 D23 Expo presentation, a 30-second first-look teaser of the film as well as first-look images were previewed.
There were quick flashes of several major settings, including Snow White's cottage in the woods, the intricately designed interior of the Queen's castle and the moss-covered forest. There were also short glimpses of Gadot as the Evil Queen questioning her magic mirror,Zegler as Snow White, and Snow White's hand falling with the poisoned apple toppling along with her. Gadot said about her role that playing the Evil Queen was "very different than what [she] had done before. [She is] used to playing the other end of where the heart should be", but she found it very "delightful" to "get under her skin". The title logo of the film was also revealed. In an interview with <i>Vanity Fair</i>, Zegler criticized the "jokes" that were being made about the film's modern updates, including her casting in the role of Snow White as a Latina, and addressed the film's approach, saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is—because it needed that. It's an 85-year-old cartoon, and our version is a refreshing story about a young woman who has a function beyond "Someday My Prince Will Come".</p><div>—Rachel Zegler</div></blockquote>

<p>Zegler later said of the changes from the original film:</p>

<blockquote><p>The original cartoon came out in 1937 and very evidently so. There's a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her... Weird! Weird. We didn't do that this time... We have a different approach to what I'm sure a lot of people will assume is a love story just because we cast a guy in the movie, Andrew Burnap, great dude. It's one of those things that I think everyone's going to have their assumptions about what it's going to be, but it's really not about the love story at all, which is really, really wonderful.</p><div>—Rachel Zegler</div></blockquote>



<h2>Release</h2>
<p>During the 2022 D23 Expo Presentation, it was announced that <i>Snow White</i> would be released in 2024. On September 15, 2022, the film was announced to have a release date of March 22, 2024.</p>



<h2>Controversies</h2>
<h3>Casting of Snow White</h3>
<p>The choice to cast Latina actress Rachel Zegler as Snow White, a character described in the original material as having skin "as white as snow," attracted some controversy. While appearing on <i>Variety</i>'s <i>Actors on Actors</i> series with Andrew Garfield, Zegler responded to the <i>Snow White</i> casting backlash with comments such as:</p>
<blockquote><p>Never in a million years did I imagine that this would be a possibility for me. You don't normally see Snow Whites that are of Latin descent. Even though Snow White is really a big deal in Spanish-speaking countries. Blanca Nieves is a huge icon whether you're talking about the Disney cartoon or just different iterations and the Grimm fairy tale and all the stories that come with it. But you don't particularly see people who look like me or are me playing roles like that. When it was announced, it was a huge thing that was trending on Twitter for days, because all of the people were angry. We need to love them in the right direction. At the end of the day, I have a job to do that I am really excited to do. I get to be a Latina princess.</p><div>—Rachel Zegler</div></blockquote>

<h3>Zegler's criticism of the 1937 film</h3>
<p>Zegler attracted criticism over statements expressing disapproval of the original film, the Prince, and Snow White's character. In response to her comments, many rebuked her for making Snow White "more feminist", while others criticized her for misinterpreting feminism, with accusations of promoting the girlboss archetype or maligning women that seek traditional feminine roles uninterested in power or leadership. Conversely, Zegler received online support from those who considered the criticism excessive and part of cancel culture. Ashten Stein, a brand strategist, felt that Zegler's statements made it appear that she had not received media training for marketing the film.</p>

<p>David Hand, whose father of the same name co-directed the original animated movie, criticized the remake, describing it as "insulting" and suggesting that his father and Walt Disney would be "turning in their graves".</p>

<p>This controversy would lead to conservative media organization <i>The Daily Wire</i> announcing deliberately on October 16, 2023 (the day of Disney's 100th anniversary) the launch of the streaming service Bentkey and the upcoming release of their own live-action adaptation of the original fairy tale, <i>Snow White and the Evil Queen</i>, set for release in 2024 in an effort to compete with Disney's version.</p>

<h3>Reimagining of the Seven Dwarfs</h3>
<p>In January 2022, during an interview on Marc Maron's <i>WTF</i> podcast, actor Peter Dinklage, who has a form of dwarfism and has played dwarfish characters in his career, commented on the upcoming live-action <i>Snow White</i> remake, dismissing it as a "backward story". In response to Dinklage's comments, Disney stated that "to avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community." Numerous other actors with dwarfism responded negatively to Dinklage's comments, feeling he was unduly speaking on their behalf and costing them roles.</p>

<p>In July 2023, footage of the production from Berkshire revealed that the depiction of the Seven Dwarfs had been reimagined for the film, consisting of only one actor with dwarfism along with six other non-dwarf actors of varying ethnicity, 6 males and 1 female portraying the associated set of seven individuals, who were originally all portrayed as supernatural beings from German folklore, not actual human beings. After initially denying reports that these images depicted the actual film production, Disney later confirmed that they did indeed depict the production, with stand-in actors substituting for the leads (the already confirmed actor Martin Klebba not appearing in said footage). The decision to reimagine the characters as such was criticised by mainstream and social media sources as being overly politically correct as well as potentially taking away acting opportunities from the dwarfism community. <i>Jackass</i> actor Jason "Wee Man" Acuña criticised Disney for not casting dwarf actors and expressed disappointment about the changes. Acuña said "You're replacing jobs that people could have as little people. It's for dwarfs. Why are you hiring 'Snow White and the seven average people'?"  Wrestler/actor Dylan Postl also disagreed with Dinklage's view and in an interview with Piers Morgan, he echoed Acuña's sentiments and defended the portrayal of the dwarf characters in the animated film.</p>
