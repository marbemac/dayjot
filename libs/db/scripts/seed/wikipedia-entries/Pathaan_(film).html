<h2>Plot</h2>
 
<p><b>2019</b>: The Indian Government revokes Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which grants special status for Jammu and Kashmir. The news impacts a cancer-ridden Pakistani army general Qadir, who decides to exact vengeance against India and signs a contract with Jim, who leads a private terrorist organization called <i>Outfit X</i>.</p>

<p><b>2020</b>: Pathaan is a RAW agent, who along with his senior officer Major Nandini Grewal open a unit dubbed "Joint Operations and Covert Research" (J.O.C.R.) in order to recruit former RAW agents and soldiers who were forced to retire due to past trauma or injury, but want to continue serving the country. With RAW joint secretary Colonel Sunil Luthra's acceptance, Pathaan and his team head to Dubai to stop Outfit X's suspected plans of attacking the President of India at a scientific conference. However, they realize that their actual plan was to kidnap two scientists Dr. Farooqui and Dr. Sahani and the information they received about the imminent attack on the President was just a ruse to mislead them.</p>

<p>Jim attacks the scientists' convoy and Pathaan tries to stop him. A fight ensues where Jim manages to escape with Dr. Sahani. At the debrief back at the agency, Luthra reveals that Jim was a former RAW agent, who was awarded the <i>Vir Puraskar</i> for his bravery after the agency could not find his body when Somalian terrorists killed his wife and unborn child after the government refused to pay out the ransom demanded in 2003. He had apparently faked his death in order to seek vengeance against the agency and country for not saving his family.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pathaan learns about the codeword dubbed "Raktbeej" and also that the dead people in Dubai were ex-agents and their money was transferred from the account of Rubina Mohsin (Rubai), a Pakistani doctor in Spain. Pathaan travels to Spain and is captured by Jim's men, where he also learns that Rubai is an ex-ISI agent. When Jim leaves his hideout, Rubai attacks Jim's men and escapes with Pathaan. Rubai reveals that Raktbeej is in Moscow, where they travel to steal it before Jim does. However, Rubai betrays Pathaan and has him captured by the Russian police. It is revealed that Jim used Rubai to make Pathaan steal the Raktbeej for himself. Pathaan is captured, tortured and taken to prison by a train, but is saved by "Tiger".</p>

<p><b>2022</b>: Pathaan travels to Africa and captures Jim's henchman Raafe. He meets Nandini and reveals about Jim purchasing two Saber missiles, while Nandini reveals Rubai's location in Paris. Pathaan meets Rubai, who reveals that the Raktbeej is a mutated smallpox virus, which was forcibly developed by a captive Dr Sahani under Jim's orders. She also expresses guilt about betraying Pathaan without knowing that her country would plan such a heinous attack. They travel to Jim's lab in Siberia and manage to recover one orb containing the virus with great difficulty, while Jim escapes with the other orb. Luthra and Nandini reach Jim's lab to take the orb back to India in order to develop a vaccine. Luthra also has Rubai arrested for having questionable loyalties.</p>

<p>At the Indian Institute of Contagious Diseases (IICD), Dr. Farooqui opens up the orb to Nandini without apparently finding anything. Jim calls them and reveals that the orb has already spread the virus in the facility. The infected scientists, along with Nandini die in the facility by shooting themselves, to curb the spread of the virus. Later, the facility is destroyed in a controlled blast. Jim provides an ultimatum to evacuate Indian soldiers out of Kashmir within 24 hours. Pathaan interrogates Raafe about the location of the missile and learns that the missile is situated in Afghanistan. After rescuing Rubai, they lure Jim's associates into a trap and attack Jim's base. Qadir is killed by Rubai after he activates the missile containing the virus. Pathaan chases after Jim with a jetpack and they both crash land into a cabin.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rubai deactivates the missile, but finds that Raktbeej is not in the missile, but instead in a passenger-bound airplane, which is about to land in Delhi. Rubai informs Pathaan, who finds that Jim has the detonator. Luthra calls the air traffic control to prevent the plane from landing in Delhi. In the cabin, Pathaan and Jim fight brutally, resulting in the cabin to begin sliding off a cliff. Despite getting stabbed by Jim, Pathaan steals the detonator, deactivates Raktbeej and kills Jim by throwing him out of the cabin as the foundation is about to break. Afterwards, Pathaan is reinstated into RAW and made as the head of J.O.C.R, while Nandini is posthumously awarded with the <i>Vir Puraskar</i> for her bravery.</p>

<p>In a mid-credits scene, Pathaan and Tiger are seen pondering about retiring and suggesting young agents who can replace them, but eventually decide to keep fighting the threats themselves.</p>

Khan's effigies and posters were burnt in various cities of Madhya Pradesh as a symbol of protest against the film. TV actor Mukesh Khanna questioned the Censor Board for passing the song despite obscenity. <i>The News Minute</i> termed the entire controversy as "shameless misreading for jingoism" and stated that there were five different costumes worn by Padukone in the song and the boycotters are criticizing this particular scene which features merely for 20 seconds as it suits their agenda. A Muslim organization also objected to the song.</p>

<p>On 29 December 2022, the Central Board of Film Certification asked the filmmakers to make some changes in the film, including in its songs citing culture and faith.

Sanghavi assured protection to multiplexes on the release of the film and instructed police chiefs of cities and districts to provide protection to the theatres.</p>

<p>On 17 January 2023, during the BJP national executive meeting in New Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told his party workers and leaders to refrain from making unnecessary remarks on films. Despite this, Bajrang Dal activists tore down posters of the film and set them on fire at a cinema hall which was about to screen the movie in Guwahati.

<h4>India</h4>
<p>Taran Adarsh of <i>Bollywood Hungama</i> rated the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and termed the film a "complete entertainer replete with action, emotions, patriotism, humour, thrill, and of course, the star power of Shah Rukh Khan". Sukanya Verma of <i>Rediff</i> gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, "Shah Rukh Khan's weathered intensity, grizzly charisma and trademark wit lends <i>Pathaan's</i> all-out, devil-may-care antics a sense of purpose that evades mindless acts of mayhem". Devesh Sharma of <i>Filmfare</i> rated the film 4 out of 5 stars and called it a "visual spectacle" while also opining that the action choreography was "truly out of this world". Saibal Chatterjee of <i>NDTV</i> rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and said, "Pathaan swings and strikes with all the style and aplomb in the world. It will be a hard act to follow". Renuka Vyavahare of <i>The Times of India</i> rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, "<i>Pathaan</i> has all the ingredients of a masala potboiler — slowmo entries, iconic battle of good versus bad and most importantly a sexy-smouldering Shah Rukh Khan, who can fight the good fight on and off the screen". Tanisha Bagchi of <i>The Quint</i> gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, "If Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff's showdown in War kept you on the edge of your seats, Shah Rukh and John's fistfights and blows are nothing short of whistle-worthy". Abhimanyu Mathur of <i>DNA India</i> rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and praised the performances and score but termed some of the action scenes as "over-the-top and unbelievable".</p>

<p>Ritika Handoo of <i>Zee News</i> rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and mentioned, "There is not even a single dull moment in this YRF actioner. The action sequences between SRK and John are over-the-top yet mind-numbing". Tushar Joshi of <i>India Today</i> rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and stated, "Shah Rukh is the heart of <i>Pathaan</i>". Pooja Biraia Jaiswal of <i>The Week</i> rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, "Pathaan is a dishoom-dishoom joy ride between Khan and his perfectly beefed-up antagonist Abraham. The intention is not to let the narrative drive the story forward, but to let the larger-than-life magic of its lead superstars cast its spell". Shubhra Gupta of <i>The Indian Express</i> rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and opined that it has "finally cracked the requirements of an action movie — non-stop action, leavened by glamorous leads, topped by the guy who can save the world, a high-octane set piece and an emo line at a time". Anna M. M. Vetticad of <i>Firstpost</i> rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and wrote, "<i>Pathaan</i> is so much fun when it's being fun especially with a smashing Salman Khan cameo – that it is tempting to overlook its play-it-safe politics".</p>

<p>Sajesh Mohan of <i>Onmanorama</i> stated that "Siddharth Anand's <i>Pathaan</i> lays out a perfect red-carpet entry for Shah Rukh Khan into the YRF Spy Universe with its right formula of high-octane death and logic-defying action sequences seasoned with desh bhakti (patriotism) and qurbani (sacrifice)." Monika Rawal Kukreja of <i>Hindustan Times</i> stated, "<i>Pathaan</i> is your true-blue commercial, masala entertainer that's not trying to send across any message or be a social commentary on the current state of affairs in the country. It's fun, non-fussy and fantastic at the same time". Nandini Ramnath of <i>Scroll.in</i> wrote, "The film's greatest blaster is its hero itself, parleying his well-oiled impishness, time-tested charm and mesmeric screen presence for a cheesy but also entertaining save-the-nation exercise".</p>

<h4>International</h4>
<p>Cath Clarke of <i>The Guardian</i> rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, "This enjoyable high-octane action spy movie from India is possibly the most fun you can currently have at the cinema. Still, the cheers kept coming; the loudest whoop of all when Salman Khan made an entrance as Tiger, a hero from an earlier movie in the series". Conversely, Simon Abrams of <i>TheWrap</i> dismissed it as "an amateurish Indian super-spy thriller that's never as well-executed as it is conceptually goofy and politically dubious". Owen Gleiberman of <i>Variety</i> was similarly not impressed, terming the film a "a sprawling, mountainous tangle of pulp that stacks one genre on top of the next with an arbitrary verve", but picked up the "iconic quality of its stars" Khan and Abraham for praise. Timon Singh of <i>Empire</i> summarised, "<i>Pathaan</i> delivers everything that an Indian blockbuster should: a guaranteed box office draw with Khan, exotic locales, crowd-pleasing cameos, stunning dance numbers and gravity-defying stunts that make the <i>Fast and Furious</i> franchise look restrained."</p>
