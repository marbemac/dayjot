In 2006, third year student Utahime Iori and sorcerer Mei Mei are assigned to investigate a haunted house that many people have gone missing from. While inspecting inside, the two realize they are trapped in an endless hallway as a result of the cursed spirit. Right as they are about to plan their escape, second year students Satoru Gojo, Suguru Geto, and Shoko Ieiri, arrive, with the former two easily disposing of the building and curse. Due to neglecting to open a curtain, they are reprimanded by their homeroom teacher, Masamichi Yaga, at Jujutsu High. After Gojo and Geto have a disagreement about the relationship between sorcerers and non-sorcerers, they are assigned a job courtesy of Master Tengen. Every 500 years, to counteract his Immortality cursed technique to prevent him from evolving beyond that of a human, Tengen merges himself with a person known as a "Star Plasma Vessel". Gojo and Geto are hired to protect the vessel, a girl named Riko Amanai, who is being targeted by two groups: the curse user sect "Q", and the religious group "Time Vessel Association". En route to Riko's, Gojo and Geto are attacked by members of Q, with the latter saving Riko. Meanwhile, due to not having the strength to fight, the Time Vessel Association hires someone to kill Riko, Toji Zen'in, now going by his wife's maiden name, Fushiguro.</td></tr>

Gojo and Geto easily dispose of the Q attackers, and after she wakes up from her unconsciousness, are formally introduced to Riko and her maid Misato Kuroi. Despite intending to take her to Jujutsu High for safety, Riko goes to school for the day, with Tengen ordering Gojo and Geto to follow her wishes, as they are aware even though she is content with her fate, she will no longer have a normal life once she is assimilated with Tengen. Meanwhile, knowing he has no chance of currently facing Gojo, Toji decides to wait and let other attackers tire them down first, adding further fuel to the fire by putting a 30-million-yen bounty on Riko's head. Geto and Kuroi face off against curse users at the school, while Gojo grabs Riko before being cornered by a curse user able to create clones of himself. Using the power of his Six Eyes and Limitless, Gojo is able to overwhelm and defeat the user, even after he fails to execute his reverse curse technique. Just then, Riko receives a text message of Kuroi tied up and captured.</td></tr>

After learning of Kuroi's abduction by the Time Vessel Association, Gojo, Geto, and Riko effortlessly storm their base in Okinawa to rescue her and decide to spend the time waiting out the bounty's deadline by hanging out on the island. Gojo lets them stay longer in order to fulfill Riko's desires, though Geto worries since Gojo has been using the Six Eyes non-stop for two days straight. Once the deadline is up, the group arrive at Tokyo Jujutsu High to prepare for the assimilation, only to suddenly be attacked by Toji, catching Gojo off guard. Gojo stays behind to fight while Geto takes Riko and Kuroi to Tengen's. During their battle, Gojo realizes that Toji has no curse energy at all, unlike normal humans, meaning that he was born with a Heavenly Restriction, granting him incredible physical prowess. Using a hoard of cursed spirits accompanying him, as well as a special-grade cursed tool designed to forcefully deactivate active cursed techniques, Toji is able to overwhelm Gojo and viciously slice at his throat and chest, seemingly killing him. Meanwhile, Riko says her tearful goodbyes to Kuroi as Geto takes her to Tengen's underground lair. He gives her the option of rejecting the assimilation, having already decided with Gojo to go against Tengen if she so wishes. Riko admits her wish to live her life as a normal person, but just as she's about to reach out to Geto, she is suddenly shot fatally in the head by Toji. Geto is stunned, and after Toji boasts about killing Gojo, Geto unleashes his cursed spirits to fight.</td></tr>

Geto uses his cursed spirits to fight Toji in revenge for Riko, as well as Gojo and Kuroi's assumed deaths, but Toji is able to dodge and counteract each attack. He also explains the process behind how he was able to hide his own cursed spirit and infiltrate into the lair. Geto attempts to absorb Toji's cursed spirit, but fails, allowing Toji to defeat him, leaving him barely alive. Toji takes Riko's corpse to the Time Vessel Association, where the representative explains how their group has evolved over the years and their obsession with Tengen. As he starts to leave, Toji is confronted by Gojo, who survived their encounter by using reverse cursed technique to heal himself. Experiencing a high while on the verge of insanity, Gojo is able to easily fight back against everything Toji throws at him, activating special applications of his Limitless ability. Toji's left side of the body is blown apart, and as he succumbs to his wounds, he reveals to Gojo that his son, Megumi, will be sold to the Zen'in clan in a few years. Geto, who was healed by Shoko, rushes to the church to find Gojo carrying Riko's body, asking if they should kill all the non-sorcerer cultists present. Geto says no, but this thought continues to linger through his head.</td></tr>

One year later, Gojo has become so adept with using his curse technique and becoming "the strongest" he has been taking on more solo missions, leaving Geto to feel more isolated with his own conflicted feelings. After talking with underclassman Yu Haibara, Geto meets Special Grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukomo, who reveals to him her desire to rid the world of cursed spirits created by the curse energy given off by non-sorcerers. Geto realizes that this is potentially possible if they killed all the non-sorcerers and forced them to adapt. After Haibara is killed during a mission, and two young sorcerer girls are discovered abused in a village, Geto makes his decision and murders everyone in the village. With this action, Geto is branded a curse user and sentenced to death, shocking Gojo. He confronts Geto who reveals his plan, having also already killed his own parents too, using Gojo's own incredible power as motivation to continue with his goals. Gojo tries to stop him but is unable to go through with it and lets him go. Geto takes over the Star Religious Group as its new leader, and Gojo meets Megumi, deciding to protect him from the Zen'in clan. In the present, Gojo awakens from his dream greeted by Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara.</td></tr>

Aoi Todo and Mei Mei suggest to the Jujutsu higher-ups for Yuji Itadori, Megumi Fushigoro, Nobara Kugisaki, Maki Zen'in, and Panda to be promoted to first-grade jujutsu sorcerer, meaning they will be assigned various missions to earn this title; Todo is disappointed to learn he won't be able to team-up with Yuji for these. During a shopping trip, Nobara is approached by Yuko Ozawa, an old classmate of Yuji's with a crush on him. She invites Megumi to discuss with Yuko about Yuji and convinces her to ask him out. After Yuji is able to easily recognize her even despite her significant change in appearance, she decides not to confess and instead focus on her own feelings and perspective. Shortly afterwards, the trio meet up with Utahime to discuss the traitor within Jujutsu High who has been working with the cursed spirits she has narrowed down: Mechamaru. They go to confront the location where Kokichi Muta's real body is located, only to find it abandoned, confirming her theory. Meanwhile, Muta is confronted by Geto and Mahito, revealing he made the vow to work with them so Mahito can use his Idle Transfiguration on him to repair his body. Due to breaking their deal and attacking the Kyoto students, he calls off their arrangement, forcing Mahito to use his cursed technique to heal his body. The two immediately begin fighting as Muta reveals a giant Ultimate Mechamaru, with the intention of using it to exorcise Mahito, before warning Gojo about the curses' plans for Shibuya on Halloween.</td></tr>

Muta utilizes his 16 years worth of stocked up cursed energy to battle Mahito in his Ultimate Mechamaru. Mahito is able to evade and regenerate most of the damage thanks to his transfiguration, however Muta ends up releasing a missile of cursed energy that directly hits Mahito, damaging part of his soul. Mahito activates his Domain Expansion, trapping Muta and the Mechamaru within, however before he can be affected by the attack, he releases another cursed energy missile, revealing to be a Simple Domain, which is able to destroy the Domain and seemingly Mahito himself. Muta prepares to use his remaining energy to attack Geto, however Mahito survived the attack, and uses the moment to catch Muta off guard, killing him. Meanwhile, Miwa talks to "Mechamaru", about how she wants to get to know everyone more. Several days later, on Halloween in Shibuya, a veil is thrown up over the city, trapping all the civilians within. Several are suddenly sucked into the train station, while the rest are told to ask for Satoru Gojo to be freed. Several sorcerer teams are positioned at the entrances of the veil, prepared to act if necessary, while Gojo enters it.</td></tr>

Gojo enters the subway crowded with civilians where he confronts the curses Jogo, Hanami, and Choso. Meanwhile, Yuji accompanies Mei Mei and her brother Ui Ui, who proceed elsewhere above ground to deal with a newly discovered veil. They discover the appearance of transfigured humans, causing Yuji to realize Mahito is around. He decides to deal with the powerful cursed spirit sensed nearby, while Mei Mei and Ui Ui take care of the transfigured humans. Yuji discovers a (semi) intelligent grasshopper cursed spirit guarding a tool that controls the veil, overpowering the curse with his raw strength and destroying the veil. Yuji, Mei Mei, and Ui Ui reconvene below ground to discover Mahito and most of the civilians are gone. Back in the subway, taking advice from Geto, Jogo uses the civilians in an attempt to distract and overcrowd Gojo. He and Hanami execute a Domain Amplification, which allows them to deactivate a person's cursed technique, forcing Gojo to jump out of the way. Gojo takes off his blindfold, prepared to take the fight seriously, while Jogo remembers Geto's words to keep him busy for 20 minutes while he prepares the Prison Realm.</td></tr>

Jogo and Hanami fight Gojo up close, while Choso attacks from the rear. Gojo successfully overwhelms Hanami by completely crushing them into a corner with his Limitless, killing them. Stunned, Jogo tries to run away while still keeping Gojo busy. Mahito then arrives with a train carrying hundreds of transfigured humans that proceed to cause immense chaos in the subway among the civilians, unleashing even more he had in hiding. Pushed into a corner, Gojo releases his Domain Expansion: Infinite Void, but only for the span of 0.2 seconds, in order to protect the civilians as best as possible. He uses this time to take out the thousand transfigured humans, however significantly tiring him out in the process. He is then confronted by the Prison Realm, but before he can escape its range, Geto greets him, shocking him and causing all his memories to come rushing back to him. He is caught off guard long enough for the Prison Realm to trap him. Before he is sealed away, Gojo confronts Geto, having figured that he is an imposter, causing "Geto" to undo the stitches on his head, revealing a mysterious brain with a mouth, and that he stole Geto's body to use his Cursed Technique for his plans. Meanwhile, a Mechamaru-like ear-piece suddenly attaches itself to Yuji, alerting him to Gojo's current fate.</td></tr>

As he is about to be sealed away, Gojo addresses the real Geto, causing Geto's hand to start choking out his body, which surprises and amuses the imposter "Pseudo-Geto". The Prison Realm is then closed, trapping Gojo. Elsewhere, Mechamaru reveals to Yuji and Mei Mei what just happened, including that he created a couple puppets as failsafes in case he died and Gojo was sealed. Mei Mei and Ui Ui stay behind to deal with several special grade cursed spirits in the subway, while Yuji runs to the surface to inform the other sorcerers of Gojo's predicament. The other teams are sent further into the veil, when Kiyotaka Ijichi is attacked by curse user Haruta Shigemo. Yuji yells out from the top of the buildings to Kento Nanami about Gojo's sealing, which is heard by the other teams. Meanwhile, the Prison Realm suddenly drops onto the ground due to Gojo's interference within, forcing them to have to wait until it stabilizes; Pseudo-Geto's group also discover Mechamaru's spying puppets. The curses then get into an argument over Yuji's fate, with Choso and Mahito wanting to kill him, while Jogo wants to resurrect Sukuna. Mahito proposes they all race to see whoever can find him first. After they leave, the Hasaba sisters confront Pseudo-Geto about giving Geto his body back, but he dismisses them. Nanami, Megumi, and Ino reconvene with Yuji, as they proceed to split up to deal with the remaining veils within Shibuya.</td></tr>

Yuji, Megumi, and Ino investigate the barrier preventing sorcerers from entering, and due to its strength deduce that the veils are being protected somewhere out in the open, which turns out to be the Shibuya Central Tower. They confront the three curse users at the top of the tower and destroy one of the veil tools; Yuji and Megumi fight the user in possession of the remaining veils, while Ino fights the other two users. The curse users lament how the balance of the world changed when Gojo was born, as fear of his incredible strength prevented them from being able to do whatever they wanted. Ino uses his Cursed Technique to fight the two curse users, a grandmother and her grandson. The grandson protects his grandmother as she completes a seance, transforming the grandson into Toji Zen'in. With Toji's strength, the grandson is able to brutally defeat Ino. Meanwhile, Yuji and Megumi fight the other curse user, who seemingly is able to repel all of their attacks. Using his Ten Shadows, Megumi is able to figure out his Cursed Technique is "Inverse", letting him reverse the strength of powerful attacks. Yuji and Megumi trip him up by throwing a barrage of weak and strong attacks at him, eventually defeating him.</td></tr>

Nanami discovers Ijichi's bloody body and escorts him to safety. Yuji and Megumi destroy the veil trapping the sorcerers in the city, however the veils trapping Gojo and the civilians remain active. They then rescue an unconscious Ino after he's dropped from the Central Tower; Megumi goes to take him to safety, while Yuji runs off to reconvene with Nanami. Meanwhile, despite the seance only supposed to copy the deceased's body, the soul of Toji is able to completely usurp the grandson's body, and under her orders to "kill all sorcerers", promptly kills the grandmother too. Elsewhere, Nobara and Nitta split up from Maki and Naobito Zen'in when they are confronted by Haruta. Nobara attempts to fight to allow Nitta to escape, but thanks to his technique is able to completely evade every attack, seriously injuring both of them. Before he can kill Nitta, Nanami arrives, resisting every one of his attacks, and brutally defeating him. He tells the two to wait and rest while he heads down to backup the Zen'ins. In the subway, Mei Mei and Ui Ui encounter Pseudo-Geto, who unleashes a Smallpox Deity cursed spirit to keep them busy. At the same time, Yuji runs into Choso, who immediately begins to fight to avenge his brothers.</td></tr>

Before his encounter with Choso, Yuji passed by civilians being attacked by cursed spirits in the streets, until Toge Inumaki arrived to handle it. Choso attacks using his cursed technique, Blood Manipulation: Convergence-Piercing Blood, catching him off guard and piercing his left arm. Choso asks Yuji for his brother's last words, where he reveals to him that they cried before dying. Yuji finds himself struggling to overcome Choso's defences and attacks, until Mechamaru re-awakens, advising Yuji of a plan. They lure Choso into the bathroom, in which Yuji has flooded it, and while the the Mechamaru robot is destroyed, the water disrupts Choso's outer blood, preventing him from going at his fullest. Despite this, Choso manages to pierce Yuji's liver, and believing he will die anyway, goes all out with the intent of taking Choso down too. However, Choso uses his blood to form a shield to protect his chest from Yuji's Divergent Fist, and knocks him unconscious. Choso is about to finish him off, to Sukuna's disappointment, when suddenly, something happens. Flashes of memories begin to flood Choso's mind of he and his brothers hanging out, including Yuji. The supposed revelation causes him to spiral in disbelief and wander away. Later, the Hasaba sisters discover the unconscious Yuji.</td></tr>
