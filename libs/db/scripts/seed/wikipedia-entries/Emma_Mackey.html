<p>Mackey was cast in her first professional role with the Netflix comedy-drama series <i>Sex Education</i> as Maeve Wiley, an intelligent, quick-witted, business-savvy "bad girl" who convinces fellow student Otis Milburn (Asa Butterfield) to start an underground sex therapy business at their school. She stated that "For me, this is my first piece of work. ... It was—and still is—a really happy time." Mackey's work on the series has earned her acclaim. <i>The Hindustan Times</i> wrote, "Emma Mackey, as Maeve, is a revelation; perhaps the best performance by a young British actress I've seen since I discovered Florence Pugh. She's alluring yet distant, pragmatic yet emotional, whip-smart yet foolishly in love." For the role, she received a British Academy Television Award nomination in 2021, and won a National Comedy Award in 2022.</p>

<p>In 2021, Mackey appeared in the independent romantic drama film <i>Eiffel</i>, which premiered at the Alliance Française French Film Festival and has  earned numerous international theatrical releases; it has grossed over $13 million worldwide. Review site DoItInParis stated that Mackey "radiates mischief in the boots of a rebellious and entire provincial bourgeoisie, a bit capricious but madly endearing." The following year, she starred in the mystery thriller film <i>Death on the Nile</i>, a sequel to 2017's <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i>, in the supporting role of Jacqueline de Bellefort.</p> 

<p>Mackey had her first lead film role as the novelist Emily Brontë in the partly fictional 2022 film <i>Emily</i>, focusing on Brontë's early life. The following year, she appeared in the fantasy comedy film <i>Barbie</i>.</p>
