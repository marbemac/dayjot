<h3>1987–1995: Early television and film roles</h3>

<p>In 1987, Sandler played Theo Huxtable's friend Smitty on <i>The Cosby Show</i> and the Stud Boy or Trivia Delinquent on the MTV game show <i>Remote Control</i>. After his film debut in <i>Going Overboard</i> in 1989, Sandler performed in comedy clubs, having first taken the stage at his brother's urging when he was 17. He was discovered by comedian Dennis Miller, who caught Sandler's act in Los Angeles and recommended him to <i>Saturday Night Live</i> producer Lorne Michaels. Sandler was hired as a writer for <i>SNL</i> in 1990, and became a featured player the following year. He made a name for himself by performing amusing original songs on the show, including "The Thanksgiving Song" and "The Chanukah Song". Sandler told Conan O'Brien on <i>The Tonight Show</i> that NBC fired him and Chris Farley from the show in 1995. Sandler used his firing as part of his monologue when he returned in 2019 to host the show.</p>

<p>In 1993, Adam Sandler appeared in the film <i>Coneheads</i> with Farley, David Spade, Dan Aykroyd, Phil Hartman, and Jane Curtin. In 1994, he co-starred in <i>Airheads</i> with Brendan Fraser and Steve Buscemi.</p>

<h3>1995–2007: Box office success and Happy Madison founding</h3>

<p>Sandler starred in <i>Billy Madison</i> (1995) playing a grown man repeating grades 1–12 to earn back his father's respect and the right to inherit his father's multimillion-dollar hotel empire. The film was successful at the box office despite negative reviews. He followed this film with <i>Bulletproof</i> (1996), and the financially successful comedies <i>Happy Gilmore</i> (1996) and <i>The Wedding Singer</i> (1998). He was initially cast in the bachelor–party–themed comedy/thriller <i>Very Bad Things</i> (1998) but had to back out due to his involvement in <i>The Waterboy</i> (1998), one of his first hits.</p>

<p>Sandler formed his film production company, Happy Madison Productions, in 1999, first producing fellow <i>SNL</i> alumnus Rob Schneider's film <i>Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo</i>. The company has produced most of Sandler's subsequent films to date, and is on the Sony/Columbia Pictures lot in Culver City, California. Most of its films have received negative reviews from critics, with three considered among the worst ever made yet most have performed well at the box office.</p>

<p>Although his earlier commercially successful films did not receive favorable critical attention, Sandler started to receive more positive reviews beginning with <i>Punch-Drunk Love</i> in 2002. <i>Punch-Drunk Love</i>'s writer and director, Paul Thomas Anderson, had an "obsession-level" love for Sandler's previous movies and wrote the film with him in mind. Sandler was intimidated to work with Anderson upon viewing his previous film <i>Magnolia</i> (2000), but these fears were alleviated upon receiving the script from Anderson. Roger Ebert's review of <i>Punch-Drunk Love</i> concluded that Sandler had been wasted in earlier films with poorly written scripts and characters with no development. Ebert noted that Sandler's character still maintained the "childlike, love-starved" persona from his previous films, but was shown in a new light as the "key to all Adam Sandler films." Sandler was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance. The film marked the beginning of Sandler moving outside the genre of slapstick comedy to take on more serious roles, such as Mike Binder's <i>Reign Over Me</i> (2007), a drama about a man who loses his entire family in the September 11 attacks and then struggles to rekindle a friendship with his old college roommate (Don Cheadle).</p>

It marked Sandler's first family film and first film under the Disney banner.</p>
