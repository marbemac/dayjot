<div>Dog breed</div>
<p>The <b>American Bully</b> is a modern breed of dog that was developed as a companion dog, and originally standardized and recognized as a breed in 2004 by the American Bully Kennel Club (ABKC). Their published breed standard describes the dog as giving the "impression of great strength for its size". In 2008, the American Bully was recognized by the European Bully Kennel Club (EBKC), and on July 15, 2013, by the United Kennel Club (UKC).  Neither the International Canine Federation, The Kennel Club, nor American Kennel Club (AKC) have recognized or accepted the American Bully into their registry as a purebred dog.</p>

<p>Temperament in adult dogs is highly dependent on training, and the breed can be very demanding and needs to be properly trained. The American Bully Kennel Club divided the American Bully into four categories, including the <i>XL</i>, <i>Pocket</i>, <i>Standard</i>, and <i>Classic</i>, whereas other registries, including the UKC, have approved one consistent size standard.</p>

<p>Due to the size, strength, and aggression level of the American Bully, legal controls on the ownership of the breed exist in several countries. The XL Bully was responsible for over 50% of the deaths caused by dogs in the UK in the period between 2021 and 2023. The British government has committed to banning the breed by the end of 2023.</p>



<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>The United Kennel Club (UKC) and American Bully Kennel Club (ABKC) breed standards are similar, except the ABKC recognises four varieties of size, based on height, whereas the UKC recognises only one standard size.</p>

<p>Within the ABKC, the four varieties are separated by height without specification of weight. All these varieties are expected to follow the same standard with minor alterations.</p>

<p>All dogs are classified and shown as <i>Standard</i> until they reach a year of age, at which point they are separated into the varieties and shown against their own type.</p>

<h3>Standard</h3>

<p>The standard American Bully type is a medium-sized dog with a compact bulky muscular body, heavy bone structure and blocky head. Male dogs must be 17 to 20in (43 to 51cm), while females must be 16 to 19in (41 to 48cm) at the withers.</p>

<h3>Pocket</h3>

<p>The "pocket" type is a smaller variant, with full-grown males 14 to 17 inches (36 to 43cm), and females 13 to 16 inches (33 to 41cm), at the withers.</p>

<h3>XL</h3>

<p>An XL type is determined by its adult height, with males 21 to 23 inches (53 to 58cm), and females 19 to 22 inches (48 to 56cm), at the withers.</p>

<h3>Classic</h3>
<p>The <i>classic</i> is a lighter-framed dog than the <i>standard</i>, but falls within the same height range. These dogs do not display the exaggerated features often found in the other varieties, and arguably display clearer American Pit Bull Terrier/American Staffordshire Terrier lineage.</p>

<h3>Non-standard sizes</h3>
<p>Outside of the breed standard, dogs shorter or taller than the named variations have been bred. Smaller dogs are sometimes called "Micro", and larger ones are called "XXL", but neither are recognized by the kennel clubs as legitimate varieties.</p>



<h2>Temperament</h2>
<p>The American Bully is a highly adaptable and trainable breed. Many dogs, despite acting as lapdogs in the home, do well in sports such as weight pull and flirt pole. Human aggression is discouraged in breed standards; however, a level of dog aggression is characteristic of the breed. Breeders have acknowledged that American Bully dogs can be very dangerous if improperly raised or bred.</p>



<h2>Health</h2>
<p>Health problems vary within the breed and span the entire spectrum, with some varieties being plagued by problems, and others being well-documented for health and quality. Testing is not as commonplace in the breed as in older breeds, though hip and elbow scoring are the most frequently conducted. Cherry eye, ectropion, and entropion are often seen affecting the eyes, while brachycephalic respiratory syndrome can be seen in the shorter muzzled dogs.</p>



<h2>History</h2>
<p>The American Bully, as it is now known, began development in the 1980s with the majority of the final behavioral and aesthetic product being completed in the 1990s. The breed's development and popularity are commonly tied to the growth of hip-hop culture.</p>

<p>There is consensus that at least five other breeds were used to attain the physical traits  desired as well as the more diminutive size of some lines. The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) was the foundation (parent breed) used to create the American Bully. The APBT has maintained a characteristic appearance and temperament for over a century, with different strains of APBT emerging within the breed, each with different physical attributes. One particular APBT strain was crossbred to create a stockier physique that breeders originally misrepresented as purebred APBTs. Eventually, enough breeders agreed that these dogs were disparate enough from APBTs that they should be called a different breed altogether. The bloodline of these mixed breeds was further influenced with openly-acknowledged breeding with the American Bulldog, English Bulldog, and Olde English Bulldogge in order to fine-tune desired physical characteristics and personality traits.</p>

<p>The breed was first recognized by its breed club, the American Bully Kennel Club (ABKC), in 2004. This registry first acted as a means to document pedigrees and show the breed against its written standard. According to the ABKC, the initial desire for this breed was to produce a dog with a lower prey drive and more of the "bully" traits and characteristics than the American Staffordshire Terrier. Mass and heavy bone was prioritized to ensure such a look, and due to this many of the dogs shown today display the wide front for which they were originally bred.</p>

<p>The American Bully is bred to be a companion dog and should not be confused with the several other bulldog-type breeds.</p>

<h3>United Kingdom</h3>

<p>American bullies first arrived in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2014 or 2015, and increased in popularity during the COVID lockdown of 2020-2021. Because the breed is not a registered breed with the UK Kennel Club, it is unknown how many dogs or breeders there are in the UK.</p>

<h4>Attacks on people</h4>

<p>In the UK, XL Bully dogs were responsible for more than 50% (10 out of 19) of the dog-related human deaths between 2021 and June 2023. The London-based pressure group, Bully Watch, which campaigns for controls on the breed, places the number of deaths related to XL Bullies at 14 between 2021 and September 2023.</p>

<p>According to Richard Barker, a National Health Service (NHS) consultant surgeon, wounds caused by XL Bullies are more severe than those caused by other breeds. He stated that the dogs' bite can shred skin and crush bones, carrying particular risk of irreparable nerve damage.</p>

<p>On March 22, 2022, a 17-month old toddler, Bella-Rae Birch, was mauled to death in St Helens, Merseyside. The dog, an American XL Bully, had been bought as a family pet one week prior.</p>

<p>On July 16, 2022, Joanne Robinson of Rotherham, England, was killed by her pet American XL Bully. The dog, one of a pair, weighed 196lb (89kg).</p>

<p>On August 10, 2022, Ian Symes, an experienced and professional dog-walker, was mauled to death by an American XL Bully while walking through a park in Fareham, Hampshire. Dr. Candy d'Sa, a dog behaviour expert who was part of a team that tested Kong before it was euthanised said: "I believe Mr Symes was having rough play with Kong. [The dog] became over-aroused and quickly became aggressive. If the dog has not been trained to stop it won't stop. The dog weighed more than the victim and standing up it would have been at face height on its hind legs."</p>

<p>On January 12, 2023, Natasha Johnston, a 28-year old dog walker, was killed whilst walking eight dogs in Surrey, England. An inquest found she died from "multiple penetrating bites to the neck". Police confirmed that one of the dogs, an American XL Bully, was believed to have been responsible for Johnston's death, and was euthanised.</p>

<p>On May 18, 2023, a 37-year old man, Jonathan Hogg, who worked as a dog carer, was killed in Leigh, near Manchester. Detective Chief Inspector John Davies said: "Greater Manchester Police officers searched two houses and seized 15 American XL Bullies (six adults and nine puppies) believed to be the same breed as that which attacked Jonathan."</p>

<h4>Move towards ban</h4>

<p>In June 2023, MP John Hayes raised the issue in the House of Commons, calling on the government to urgently ban the XL Bully following attacks in recent years. The Kennel Club has argued that the problem rests with irresponsible dog owners, and that an outright ban of certain dog breeds will not address that.</p>

<p>On 11 September 2023, following an attack on an 11-year-old girl by an XL Bully, Home Secretary Suella Braverman requested urgent advice on the feasibility of banning the breed. It was reported that there were concerns within Defra, the government department responsible for administering the Dangerous Dogs Act, over the practicality of a ban. Four days later on 15 September, it was announced that a man had died after being attacked by two dogs believed to be Bully XLs. Shortly thereafter Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed that the Bully XL would be banned by the end of the year. Following this announcement a protest took place within London against the ban.</p>

<p>On 4 October 2023, a man was arrested on suspicion of murder after his dog, believed to be a Bully XL, fatally mauled a 54-year old man in Sunderland.</p>

<h4>Criminal activity</h4>
<p>Prior to 2020, no seizures of American Bullies by the Metropolitan Police, covering the Greater London, were reported. In 2022, the force seized 479 out-of-control dogs under the Dangerous Dogs Act. The American Bully was the second most commonly seized breed, with 73 dogs seized. In the first five months of 2023 the force seized 44 American bullies, almost three times the next most common breed, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, of which 16 had been seized.</p>

<p>In January 2023, a British Broadcasing Corporation (BBC) investigation found that organized crime in the UK was moving into the lucrative market of extreme dog breeding, specifically American Bullies, as a means of money laundering.</p>



<h2>Breed-specific legislation</h2>

<h3>Ireland</h3>
<p>In Ireland, the American Bully is restricted as a 'Bandog'. It must be muzzled and on a lead no longer than 2 metres (6ft 7in) when in public, amongst other requirements.</p>

<h3>Turkey</h3>
<p>In Turkey, it is illegal to own or breed an American Bully.</p>

<h3>United Arab Emirates</h3>
<p>The United Arab Emirates "prohibits the possession and circulation of the American Bully for individuals and commercial establishments."</p>

<h3>United Kingdom</h3>

<p>In September 2023, following a series of severe and fatal attacks in the UK, it was announced that ownership of the XL Bully would be banned in the country by the end of 2023. The months between the announcement and ban would be used for experts to properly define the breed.</p>
