<p><i><b>The Equalizer</b></i> is an American spy thriller multimedia franchise initially co-created by Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim. It originated with a CBS television series from 1985 to 1989 starring Edward Woodward.

A series of novels featuring Robert McCall has been written by original co-creator Michael Sloan with the first volume published in 2014.</p>

<p>The franchise centers on a retired intelligence agent with a mysterious past, who uses the skills from their former career to exact justice on behalf of innocent people who find themselves in dangerous circumstances, while sometimes also dealing with people from their past in covert operations who want to pull them back in or settle old scores.</p>

<p>The original show ran for four seasons of 22 episodes each. It was initially renewed for a fifth season (causing Keith Szarabajka to turn down a role on <i>Midnight Caller</i>). The show was later cancelled, though, due to a row between CBS and Universal Studios over the renewal of <i>Murder, She Wrote</i>. In <i>The Story of The Equalizer</i>, created for the DVD box set, executive producer Coleman Luck also stated that Universal requested a script for a crossover episode with <i>Magnum, P.I.</i> despite the objections of the crew due to the vastly different tones of the two shows. Ultimately, the crossover did not happen, and the episode was rewritten as "Beyond Control".</p>

<p>The show's theme music was created by composer/performer Stewart Copeland, his first effort at theme music composition in what would become a lengthy career in that field. The track is called "Busy Equalizing". An extended version appears on his album <i>The Equalizer and Other Cliff Hangers</i>.</p>

<h3>Reboot series (2021–present)</h3>
