<h2>Early life and education</h2>
<p>Kenneth Charles Branagh was born in Belfast on 10 December 1960, the son of working-class Protestant parents Frances (née Harper) and William Branagh. His father was a plumber and joiner who ran a company that specialised in fitting partitions and suspended ceilings. He is the middle of three children, with an older brother and a younger sister, and lived in the Tigers Bay area of Belfast. He was educated at Grove Primary School. In early 1970, at the age of nine, Branagh moved with his family to England to escape the Troubles; they settled in Berkshire, where Branagh grew up in Reading and attended Whiteknights Primary School and Meadway School in Tilehurst. He appeared in school productions such as <i>Toad of Toad Hall</i> and <i>Oh, What a Lovely War!</i></p>

<p>At school, Branagh learned to speak with an RP accent to avoid bullying. Discussing his identity, he later said, "I feel Irish. I don't think you can take Belfast out of the boy." He also attributes his "love of words" to his Irish heritage. He attended the amateur Reading Cine &amp; Video Society (now called Reading Film &amp; Video Makers) and was a keen member of Progress Theatre, of which he is now the patron. After disappointing A-level results in English, history, and sociology, he went on to train at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. In 1980, RADA's principal Hugh Cruttwell asked Branagh to perform a soliloquy from <i>Hamlet</i> for Queen Elizabeth II during one of her visits to the academy.</p>



<h2>Career</h2>
<h3>1980–1988: Rise to prominence</h3>

<p>Branagh's first film appearance was as an uncredited role as a Cambridge student in the sports drama <i>Chariots of Fire</i> (1981). Branagh achieved early success in his native Northern Ireland for his role as Billy, the title character in the BBC's <i>Play for Today</i> trilogy known as the <i>Billy Plays</i> (1982–84), written by Graham Reid and set in Belfast. He received acclaim in the UK for his stage performances, first winning the 1982 SWET Award for Best Newcomer, for his role as Judd in Julian Mitchell's <i>Another Country</i>, after leaving RADA. Branagh was part of the new wave of actors to emerge from the academy. Others included Jonathan Pryce, Juliet Stevenson, Alan Rickman, Anton Lesser, Bruce Payne and Fiona Shaw. In 1984, he appeared in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of <i>Henry V</i>, directed by Adrian Noble. The production played to sold-out audiences, especially at the Barbican in the City of London. It was this production that he adapted for the film version of the play in 1989. He and David Parfitt founded the Renaissance Theatre Company in 1987, following success with several productions on the London Fringe, including Branagh's full-scale production of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> at the Lyric Studio, co-starring with Samantha Bond.</p>

<p>The first major Renaissance production was Branagh's Christmas 1987 staging of <i>Twelfth Night</i> at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, starring Richard Briers as Malvolio and Frances Barber as Viola, and with an original score by actor, musician, and composer Patrick Doyle, who two years later was to compose the music for Branagh's film adaptation of <i>Henry V</i>. This <i>Twelfth Night</i> was later adapted for television. Also in 1987, Branagh found his first leading film role as James Moon in the British film adaptation of J.L. Carr's book <i>A Month in The Country</i>. Here he plays a homosexual ex-army officer who following the war, has taken on a job to excavate a burial in the churchyard, instead he spends most of his time looking for Saxon treasures. Its set in a 1920s rural Yorkshire village where he meets Colin Firth, also in his first major role.</p>

<p>Branagh became a major presence in the media and on the British stage when Renaissance collaborated with Birmingham Rep for a 1988 touring season of three Shakespeare plays under the umbrella title of <i>Renaissance Shakespeare on the Road</i>, which also played a repertory season at the Phoenix Theatre in London. It featured directorial debuts for Judi Dench with <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> (starring Branagh and Samantha Bond  as Benedick and Beatrice), Geraldine McEwan with <i>As You Like It</i>, and Derek Jacobi directing Branagh in the title role in <i>Hamlet</i>, with Sophie Thompson as Ophelia. Critic Milton Shulman of the London <i>Evening Standard</i> wrote: "On the positive side Branagh has the vitality of Olivier, the passion of Gielgud, the assurance of Guinness, to mention but three famous actors who have essayed the role. On the negative side, he has not got the magnetism of Olivier, nor the mellifluous voice quality of Gielgud nor the intelligence of Guinness."</p>

<h3>1989–1999: Breakthrough</h3>

<p>A year later, in 1989, Branagh co-starred with Emma Thompson in the Renaissance company's stage revival of <i>Look Back in Anger</i>. Judi Dench directed both the theatre and television productions, presented first in Belfast then at the London Coliseum and Lyric Theatre. In 1990, he wrote his autobiography <i>Beginning</i>, recounting his life and acting career up to that point. In the book's introduction, he admits that the main reason for producing the book was "money" and that "The deal was made, and a handsome advance was paid out. The advance provided the funds to buy accommodation for the Company's offices, this moving Renaissance out of my flat and bringing me a little closer to sanity."</p>

<p>Notable non-Shakespeare films in which Branagh has acted in and directed include the neo-noir romantic thriller <i>Dead Again</i> (1991) starring Branagh, Emma Thompson, Andy Garcia, and Derek Jacobi. The film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival where it competed for the Golden Bear and received critical acclaim. The following year he directed the British comedy-drama film <i>Peter's Friends</i>, with a cast including former student friends Emma Thompson, Hugh Laurie, Tony Slattery, and Stephen Fry, as well as Imelda Staunton and Rita Rudner. The film received positive reviews with critics comparing it favorably as the British version of <i>The Big Chill</i> (1982). The film earned two Evening Standard British Film Awards for Branagh and Thompson.</p>

<p>Branagh is known for his film adaptations of William Shakespeare, beginning with <i>Henry V</i> (1989), returned with Shakespeare's romantic comedy <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> (1993). The film premiered at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival where it competed for the Palme d'Or. The film starred Branagh, Thompson, Denzel Washington, Kate Beckinsale, Keanu Reeves, and Michael Keaton. Vincent Canby film critic of <i>The New York Times</i> praised Branagh's direction writing, "Now he has accomplished something equally difficult. He has taken a Shakespearean romantic comedy, the sort of thing that usually turns to mush on the screen, and made a movie that is triumphantly romantic, comic and, most surprising of all, emotionally alive."</p>

<p>However Branagh had a career misstep with his adaptation of the horror film <i>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</i> (1994). The film starred Branagh, Robert De Niro, Helena Bonham Carter, Tom Hulce, and Ian Holm. It premiered at the London Film Festival where it received negative reviews. <i>The New York Times</i> film critic Janet Maslin wrote of Branagh's failure, "[He] is in over his head. He displays neither the technical finesse to handle a big, visually ambitious film nor the insight to develop a stirring new version of this story. Instead, this is a bland, no-fault <i>Frankenstein</i> for the '90s, short on villainy but loaded with the tragically misunderstood". He then directed the minor British romantic comedy <i>In the Bleak Midwinter</i> (1995) to positive reviews.</p>

<p>Also in 1995, Branagh portrayed Iago in Oliver Parker's <i>Othello</i> (1995) acting opposite Laurence Fishburne as Othello. The film received largely positive reviews, particularly for Branagh's performance which earned a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role nomination. Janet Maslin of <i>The New York Times</i> praised his acting writing, "Mr Branagh's superb performance, as the man whose Machiavellian scheming guides the story of Othello's downfall, guarantees this film an immediacy that any audience will understand."</p>

<p>Branagh returned to directing, in the acclaimed adaptation of <i>Hamlet</i> (1996). Critics have theorised it might be the greatest film adaptation of <i>Hamlet</i> of all time. The film is noted for its epic scale and cast. The film ran four hours and was shot completely in 70 mm film. The cast includes Branagh, Kate Winslet, Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie and Rufus Sewell. Critic Roger Ebert of <i>The Chicago Sun-Times</i> praised Branagh's direction and acting, declaring, "One of the tasks of a lifetime is to become familiar with the great plays of Shakespeare. 'Hamlet' is the most opaque. Branagh's version moved me, entertained me and made me feel for the first time at home in that doomed royal court." The film received four Academy Award nominations including for Best Adapted Screenplay for Branagh.</p>

<p>Post-<i>Hamlet</i>, Branagh took a break from directing choosing to act in films directed by auteur directors. He starred in Robert Altman's legal thriller <i>The Gingerbread Man</i> (1998), Paul Greengrass' dramedy <i>The Theory of Flight</i> (1998) and Woody Allen's celebrity satire <i>Celebrity</i> (1998). The following year he starred in the Western film <i>Wild Wild West</i> opposite Will Smith, Kevin Kline, and Salma Hayek, which received negative reviews. During this time Branagh took on voice roles playing the title role in BBC radio broadcasts of <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i>, and the role of Edmund in King Lear. Branagh has narrated several audiobooks, such as <i>The Magician's Nephew</i> by C. S. Lewis and <i>Heart of Darkness</i> by Joseph Conrad. In 1998, he narrated the 24-episode documentary series <i>Cold War</i>. Branagh also narrated the BBC documentaries <i>Walking with Dinosaurs</i>, <i>World War I in Colour</i>, <i>Walking with Beasts</i> and <i>Walking with Monsters</i>, and the BBC miniseries <i>Great Composers</i>.</p>

The film was acclaimed by critics with Peter Bradshaw of <i>The Guardian</i> writing, "There is a terrific warmth and tenderness to Branagh’s elegiac, autobiographical movie about the Belfast of his childhood: spryly written, beautifully acted and shot in a lustrous monochrome, with set pieces, madeleines and epiphanies that feel like a more emollient version of Terence Davies." Stephen Farber of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> noted, "[While] Branagh’s most personal film is imperfect, the emotion that it builds in the final section, as the family plays out a wrenching universal drama of emigration, is searing". The film earned seven Academy Award nominations including for
Best Picture and Best Director. Branagh won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He also won the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film.</p>

His 5th nomination came for his portrayal of Laurence Olivier in <i>My Week With Marilyn</i> in 2012. This was followed by three nominations in 2022 for <i>Belfast</i> – his first nominations for Original Screenplay and Best Picture, winning for Original Screenplay.

<p>On 10 July 2009, Branagh was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the RomaFictionFest. He was also listed on the <i>Radio Times's</i> TV 100 power list in 2023.</p>

<p>He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to drama and to the community in Northern Ireland. He received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 9 November 2012; afterwards, Branagh told a BBC reporter that he felt "humble, elated, and incredibly lucky" to be knighted.</p>

<p>In October 2015, it was announced that Branagh would be the new President of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), succeeding the late Richard, Lord Attenborough.

In October 2017, it was announced that Branagh would be conferred with the Freedom of the City of Belfast.
