<p>She grew up in a large Edwardian house, near Leamington Spa, saying, "My childhood was pretty fun. We had pigsties, barns and a paddock, and used to muck around in the mud." Turner had a tutor on the set of <i>Game of Thrones</i> until age 16. She achieved five GCSE A-grades and four Bs, including a B in Drama.</p>



<h2>Career</h2>

<p>In March 2017, she announced she had become patron of Women for Women, an organisation that supports female war survivors. In August 2017, Turner said she believed her social media following was responsible for her successful casting in an unnamed project rather than her abilities as an actress, saying, "[I]t was between me and another girl who is a far better actress than I am, far better, but I had the followers, so I got the job." In June 2017, she began a collaboration with Wella Hair, becoming its first international brand ambassador.</p>

<p>In November 2017, Turner was cast to play Juliane Koepcke in the movie <i>Girl Who Fell From the Sky</i>. She is also attached to produce the movie. In March and April 2018, she filmed the independent film <i>Heavy</i> in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Turner reprised her role as Jean Grey in the <i>X-Men</i> film <i>Dark Phoenix</i>, which takes place in 1992 and follows the events of <i>Apocalypse</i>. The film was released in June 2019.</p>

<p>She has been featured in print work for the luxury designer brand Louis Vuitton. In September 2019, Turner was cast in the thriller television show <i>Survive</i>.</p>

<p>In 2022, Turner appeared in a minor role as Erica in the teen black comedy <i>Do Revenge</i>. Turner figures in a pivotal scene where her character is accused of drug possession and has an "over-the-top" reaction. The scene went viral due to Turner's delivery of the line, which she admitted was intentionally played to emulate cinema outbursts from actors like Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson.</p>



<h2>Personal life</h2>
<p>Turner began dating American singer Joe Jonas in 2016. They became engaged in October 2017 and were married on 1 May 2019 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Following her marriage, Turner legally changed her last name to Jonas. The couple lived in New York City as of May2019. They held a second wedding ceremony in Carpentras, France on 29 June 2019. The couple have two daughters, born July 2020 and July 2022. Turner was the inspiration behind the song "Hesitate", written as a love letter to her by Jonas, for the Jonas Brothers reunion album, <i>Happiness Begins</i>.</p>

<p>In early September 2023, Jonas filed for divorce from Turner in Miami, Florida. This was then confirmed by both Turner and Jonas via Instagram to be a mutual decision. Later that month, she sued her estranged husband to allow her daughters, who were born in the United States, to return to England, as the former couple had registered the latter as their permanent residence in April earlier that year. Jonas and Turner reached a temporary custody agreement in October.</p>
