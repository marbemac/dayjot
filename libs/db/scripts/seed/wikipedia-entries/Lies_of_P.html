<h2>Plot</h2>
<h3>Setting</h3>
<p>Inspired by Carlo Collodi's novel <i>The Adventures of Pinocchio</i>, <i>Lies of P</i> tells the story of Pinocchio, a robotic puppet who differs from other puppets in his ability to lie, which plays a role during important story decisions. </p>

<p>Puppets were invented in the city of Krat thanks to the discovery of a revolutionary power source called Ergo underneath it. Puppets soon became ubiquitous throughout the city, performing menial labour for the populace. Foremost among puppet inventors is both Lorenzini Venigni and the legendary Geppetto, who created Pinocchio. In order to ensure that puppets would not be a threat, they were bound to the Grand Covenant, which forbids them from lying or attacking humans. However, despite this, one day they revolt and slaughter most of Krat's human population. Puppets have their own language, which consists of blurred English text that becomes visible during boss fights against enemy puppets. </p>

<p>Krat also suffers from the mysterious and incurable Petrification Disease, which blinds its victims before petrifying and killing them. It can also mutate them into hideous monsters.</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Pinocchio awakens in an abandoned train and finds himself in the city of Krat, where its population of puppets has rebelled against the Grand Covenant and slaughtered most of the human population. Pinocchio eventually makes his way to Hotel Krat, where some survivors have taken shelter, including a mysterious woman named Sophia. Sophia informs Pinocchio that he must find and rescue his creator, Geppetto, who is the only person who knows how to stop the puppet revolt. She then gives Pinocchio a lantern containing a cricket named Gemini to guide him on his quest.</p>

<p>As Pinocchio explores Krat, he battles both the puppets and a group known as Stalkers: animal masked humans who went insane and will kill any puppet on sight. Two of their members are the Red Fox and Black Cat, who watch over Pinocchio. He also fights citizens who were mutated by the Petrification Disease into inhuman monsters. Eventually, he manages to find Geppetto, who informs him that the puppets are being driven mad by the Puppet King, who is controlling them through the Ergo powering them. Pinocchio hunts down the Puppet King and destroys it, greatly weakening the rogue puppets since they no longer have a leadership. Geppetto then instructs Pinocchio to find the Alchemists, who have allegedly created a cure for the Petrification Disease. However, when Pinocchio heads out to meet the Alchemists, he is instead attacked by more mutated humans who became cyborgs. The Alchemists' leader, Simon Manus, then arrives and boasts that the Alchemists have managed to exploit the Petrification Disease for their own ends, using it to accelerate human evolution and create the monsters spreading throughout Krat. He also reveals that Ergo is created from humans and is the physical embodiment of their memories and life force.</p>

<p>Pinocchio makes his way back to Hotel Krat, only to find that Simon attacked the hotel with the Black Rabbit Brotherhood and kidnapped Geppetto. He commandeers a submarine to reach Simon's base on the Isle of Alchemists. He fights his way into Simon's castle, where he finds Sophia's real body heavily mutated from exposure to Ergo, with the Sophia he encountered before being an illusion created by her disembodied soul. Sophia pleads for Pinocchio to end her suffering, and he has a choice of whether to let her live or give her peace. Pinocchio continues to fight his way through the castle and against Simon's minions before confronting Simon himself, who has infused himself with Ergo and become a godlike being. Pinocchio defeats Simon and reunites with Geppetto, who promises to use the Ergo Simon collected to turn Pinocchio into a human. However, he must hand over his heart to complete the process. </p>

<ul><li>If Pinocchio gives Geppetto his heart, Pinocchio dies as Geppetto uses the heart to revive his deceased son Carlo. Geppetto then has Carlo murder all of the survivors in Hotel Krat before leaving the city with him. This unlocks a post game secret where Geppetto has turned the survivors into puppets that repeat the phrase: "Your wish is my command Sir Carlo, what would you like to do?". A letter he left behind reveals he wants to "stabilize" Krat by converting citizens into puppets to prevent the spread of the Petrification Disease and make the city safe for Carlo.</li>
<li>If Pinocchio gained enough humanity from telling lies and performing several other actions throughout the game, he may have the option to refuse to give his heart instead. If he refuses, Geppetto angrily activates the Nameless Puppet to take his heart by force. However, when the Nameless Puppet aims for Pinocchio's heart, Geppetto sacrifices himself to protect it, allowing Pinocchio to rip out the puppet's core. Depending on Pinocchio's choice after finding Sophia, one of two different endings can occur. If he let Sophia live, Geppetto bitterly calls him a useless puppet before dying. If he gave Sophia peace, he sheds a tear for Geppetto, who upon seeing this apologizes to Pinocchio as his son before dying; later that day, Pinocchio transfers Sophia's Ergo into a puppet replica of her to revive her and collapses in her arms, where she smiles upon seeing him again.</li></ul>

<p>In a post credits scene, a man named Philippus Paracelsus, posing as a merchant called Giangio, reports the results of the "Krat experiment" to his superior. He explains that Pinocchio may hold one of the keys to eternal life, and that he will continue the search for another key, Dorothy. Back in Krat, a girl wearing red shoes is seen on the rooftops, and clicks her heels three times.</p>
