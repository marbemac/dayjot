In the next two years, <i>Forbes</i> listed her among the World's 100 Most Powerful Women, and in 2022, she was named in the BBC 100 Women list.</p>

<p>Chopra accepted offers to join the Indian film industry following her pageant wins. Her acting debut came in the Tamil film <i>Thamizhan</i> (2002), followed by her first Bollywood feature in <i>The Hero: Love Story of a Spy</i> (2003). She played the leading lady in the box-office hits <i>Andaaz</i> (2003) and <i>Mujhse Shaadi Karogi</i> (2004) and had her breakout role in the 2004 romantic thriller <i>Aitraaz</i>. Chopra established herself with starring roles in the top-grossing productions <i>Krrish</i> and <i>Don</i> (both 2006), and later reprised her role in their sequels. For playing a troubled model in the drama <i>Fashion</i> (2008), Chopra won a National Film Award and a Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Chopra gained further praise for portraying a range of characters in the films <i>Kaminey</i> (2009), <i>7 Khoon Maaf</i> (2011), <i>Barfi!</i> (2012), <i>Mary Kom</i> (2014), <i>Dil Dhadakne Do</i> (2015) and <i>Bajirao Mastani</i> (2015).</p>

<p>From 2015 to 2018, Chopra starred as Alex Parrish in the ABC thriller series <i>Quantico</i>, becoming the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. Founding the production company Purple Pebble Pictures in 2015, she produced several films under it, including the Marathi films <i>Ventilator</i> (2016) and <i>Paani</i> (2019), and the self-starring Hindi biopic <i>The Sky Is Pink</i> (2019).

Her namesake foundation for health and education works towards providing support to underprivileged Indian children.

On Instagram, Chopra is the most-followed Indian actor.</p>



<h2>Early life</h2>
<img alt="Priyanka Chopra and her family are looking towards the camera." src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Priyanka_Chopra_Family.jpg/240px-Priyanka_Chopra_Family.jpg" height="161" width="240" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Priyanka_Chopra_Family.jpg/360px-Priyanka_Chopra_Family.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Priyanka_Chopra_Family.jpg 2x" />Chopra with her parents and brother in 2012
<p>Chopra was born on 18 July 1982 in Jamshedpur, Bihar (present-day Jharkhand), to Ashok and Madhu Chopra, both physicians in the Indian Army. Her father was a Punjabi Hindu from Ambala. Her mother, Madhu Chopra from Jharkhand, is the eldest daughter of Dr. Manohar Kishan Akhouri, a former Congress veteran, and Madhu Jyotsna Akhouri, a former member of Bihar Legislative Assembly.</p>

<p>Chopra's maternal grandmother, Mrs. Akhouri, was a Malayali Jacobite Syrian Christian originally named Mary John, belonging to the Kavalappara family of Kumarakom, Kottayam district, Kerala. Chopra has a brother, Siddharth, who is seven years her junior. Bollywood actresses Parineeti Chopra, Meera Chopra, and Mannara Chopra are cousins.</p>

<p>Owing to Chopra's parents' professions as military physicians, the family was posted in a number of places in India, including Delhi, Chandigarh, Ambala, Ladakh, Lucknow, Bareilly, and Pune. Among the schools she attended were La Martiniere Girls' School in Lucknow and St. Maria Goretti College in Bareilly.</p>

<p>In an interview published in <i>Daily News and Analysis</i>, Chopra said that she did not mind travelling regularly and changing schools; she welcomed it as a new experience and a way to discover India's multicultural society. Among the many places that she lived, Chopra has fond memories as a child of playing in the valleys of Leh, in the cold northwestern Indian desert region of Ladakh. She had said, "I think I was in Class 4 when I was in Leh. My brother was just born. My dad was in the army and was posted there. I stayed in Leh for a year, and my memories of that place are tremendous. We were all army kids there. We weren't living in houses, we were in bunkers in the valley and there was a stupa right on top of a hill which used to overlook our valley. We used to race up to the top of the stupa". She now considers Bareilly her home town, and maintains strong connections there.</p>

<p>At 13, Chopra moved to the United States to study, living with her aunt, and attending schools in Newton, Massachusetts, and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, after a stop in Queens, New York, as her aunt's family also moved frequently. While in Massachusetts, she participated in several theatre productions, and studied Western classical music, and choral singing. During her teenage years in the United States, Chopra sometimes faced racial issues and was bullied for being Indian by an African-American classmate. She has said, "I was a gawky kid, had low self-esteem, came from a modest middle-class background, had white marks on my legs. But I was damn hard working. Today, my legs sell 12 brands." After three years, Chopra returned to India, finishing the senior year of her high-school education at the Army Public School in Bareilly.</p>

<p>During this period, Chopra won the local May Queen beauty pageant, after which she was pursued by admirers; her family equipped their home with bars for her protection. Her mother entered her in the Femina Miss India contest of 2000; she finished second, winning the Femina Miss India World title. Chopra next won the Miss World pageant, where she was crowned Miss World 2000 and Miss World Continental Queen of Beauty—Asia &amp; Oceania at the Millennium Dome in London on 30 November 2000. Chopra was the fifth Indian contestant to win Miss World, and the fourth to do so within seven years. She had enrolled in college, but left after winning the Miss World pageant. Chopra said that the Miss India and Miss World titles brought her recognition, and she began receiving offers for film roles.  In 2001, the bridge of Chopra's nose collapsed during nasal surgery to remove a polyp.  She fell into depression over her "completely different" appearance, but was satisfied with the results of corrective surgeries.</p>

<h3>Career beginnings and breakthrough (2002–2004)</h3>

<p>After winning Miss India World, Chopra was cast as the female lead in Abbas–Mustan's romantic thriller <i>Humraaz</i> (2002), in which she was to make her film debut. However, this fell through for various reasons: she stated the production conflicted with her schedule, while the producers said they recast because Chopra took on various other commitments. Her screen debut occurred in the 2002 Tamil film <i>Thamizhan</i> as the love interest of the protagonist, played by Vijay. A review published in <i>The Hindu</i> was appreciative of the film for its wit and dialogue; however it felt that Chopra's role was limited from an acting viewpoint.</p>

<p>In 2003, Chopra made her Bollywood film debut as the second female lead opposite Sunny Deol and Preity Zinta in Anil Sharma's <i>The Hero: Love Story of a Spy</i>. Set against the backdrop of the Indian Army in Kashmir, the film tells the story of an RAW agent's fight against terrorism. <i>The Hero</i> emerged as one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films that year, but received mixed reviews from critics. Derek Elley from <i>Variety</i> said that "mega-looker Chopra makes a solid screen debut." Later that year she appeared in Raj Kanwar's box-office success <i>Andaaz</i> with Akshay Kumar, sharing the female lead with debutante Lara Dutta. Chopra played a vivacious young woman who falls in love with Kumar's character. The <i>Hindustan Times</i> noted the glamour that she brought to the role; Kunal Shah of Sify praised her performance and stated she had "all the qualities to be a star." Her performance earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut (along with Dutta) and a Best Supporting Actress nomination.</p>

<p>Chopra's first three releases in 2004—<i>Plan</i>, <i>Kismat</i>, and <i>Asambhav</i>—performed poorly at the box office. Chopra was typically cast during this earlier period as a "glamour quotient", in roles that were considered forgettable by film critic Joginder Tuteja. Later that year she starred with Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar in David Dhawan's romantic comedy <i>Mujhse Shaadi Karogi</i>, which opened to commercial success and emerged the third-highest-grossing film of the year in India.</p>

<p>In late 2004, she starred opposite Kumar and Kareena Kapoor in Abbas–Mustan's romantic thriller <i>Aitraaz</i>. Chopra considers her first role as an antagonist, portraying Soniya Roy, an ambitious woman who accuses her employee of sexual harassment, as the "biggest learning experience of her career". The film was a critical and commercial success, and Chopra's performance received critical acclaim. The <i>Hindustan Times</i> cited it as the film that changed her career significantly. A reviewer writing for the <i>BBC</i> said, "<i>Aitraaz</i> is Chopra's film. As the deliciously wicked, gold digging, scheming seductress, she chews up every scene she is in with her magnetic screen presence." She won a Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, becoming the second and final actress to win the award after Kajol (the category was discontinued in 2008). Chopra also received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress, and the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.</p>

<h3>Rise to prominence (2005–2006)</h3>
<p>In 2005,  Chopra appeared in 6 films. Her first two releases, the action thrillers <i>Blackmail</i> and <i>Karam</i>, were critically and commercially unsuccessful. Shilpa Bharatan-Iyer of <i>Rediff.com</i> considered <i>Blackmail</i> to be a very predictable film and believed that her role as a police commissioner's wife was very limited from an acting point of view. Her performance in <i>Karam</i> was better received, Subhash K. Jha wrote that Chopra "with her poised interpretation of high drama, flies high creating a character whose vulnerability and beauty are endorsed by both the inner and outer worlds created for her character."  Later that year Chopra played the wife of Akshay Kumar in Vipul Amrutlal Shah's family drama <i>Waqt: The Race Against Time</i>, the story of a small businessman (played by Amitabh Bachchan) who, hiding his illness, wants to teach his irresponsible son some lessons before he dies. During production, Chopra revisited Leh, a favourite childhood haunt, for the shooting of the song "Subah Hogi". She suffered an accident during the filming for the song "Do Me A Favour Let's Play Holi" when she electrocuted herself, spending a day recovering in hospital. The film was well received by critics, and was a commercial success.</p>

<p>She next starred opposite Arjun Rampal in the romantic mystery thriller <i>Yakeen</i>, portraying the role of a possessive lover. Critical reaction towards the film was mixed, but her performance received praise. Taran Adarsh wrote that Chopra "is bound to win laurels yet again [...] the actor is emerging as one of the finest talents in these fast-changing times". Her next release was Suneel Darshan's romance <i>Barsaat</i>, co-starring Bobby Deol and Bipasha Basu. The film was a critical and commercial failure in India, but fared better in the overseas market. Chopra's performance received mixed reviews, with Bollywood Hungama describing it as "mechanical". However, Rediff.com considered Chopra to be an "epitome of calm intelligence, who underplayed her role to perfection". Later that year, Rohan Sippy cast her alongside Abhishek Bachchan, Ritesh Deshmukh and Nana Patekar in the comedy <i>Bluffmaster!</i>. Chopra played independent working woman Simran Saxena, Bachchan's love interest. The film proved to be a box-office success.</p>

<p>After starting 2006 with special appearances in three films, Chopra starred in Rakesh Roshan's superhero film <i>Krrish</i> (a sequel to the 2003 science-fiction film <i>Koi... Mil Gaya</i>). Co-starring with Hrithik Roshan, Rekha and Naseeruddin Shah, Chopra played a young television journalist who schemes to take advantage of an innocent young man with remarkable physical abilities, but eventually falls in love with him. The film was the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India and grossed over ₹1.17 billion (US$15million) worldwide attaining a blockbuster status. Her next film was Dharmesh Darshan's romantic comedy <i>Aap Ki Khatir</i>, co-starring Akshaye Khanna, Ameesha Patel and Dino Morea. Neither the film nor Chopra's performance were well received. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com stated that Chopra's portrayal of Anu was "erratically sketched" and that her character was never consistent: "first flaky, then cool, and later, sensitive".</p>

<p>Chopra's final release of 2006 was Farhan Akhtar's action-thriller <i>Don</i> (a remake of the 1978 film of the same name), with Shah Rukh Khan. Chopra portrayed Roma (played by Zeenat Aman in the original film), who joins the underworld to avenge Don for killing her brother. Chopra received martial-arts training for her role in the movie, and performed her own stunts. The film was declared a box-office success in India and overseas, with revenues of ₹1.05 billion (US$13million). Raja Sen of Rediff.com found Chopra to be film's "big surprise"; he believed that Chopra convincingly portrayed Roma, "looking every bit the competent woman of action" and wrote "This is an actress willing to push herself, and has definite potential for screen magic. Not to mention a great smile."</p>

<h3>Setbacks and resurgence (2007–2008)</h3>
<p>In 2007, Chopra had two leading roles. Her first film was Nikhil Advani's <i>Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love</i>, a romantic comedy-drama in six chapters with an ensemble cast. She was featured opposite Salman Khan in the first chapter as Kamini, an item girl and aspiring actress who tries to land the lead role in a Karan Johar film with a publicity gimmick. Film critic Sukanya Verma praised her flair for comedy, especially her impressions of Meena Kumari, Nargis and Madhubala. Both <i>Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love</i> and her next film, <i>Big Brother</i>, proved unsuccessful at the domestic box office.</p>

<p>In 2008, Chopra starred opposite Harman Baweja in his father's <i>Love Story 2050</i>. Chopra played a double role, so she colored her hair twice; once red to portray the girl from the future and then black for the girl of the past. Her performance was poorly received; Rajeev Masand was unimpressed with Chopra's chemistry with her co-star, remarking that her character "fails to inspire either affection or sympathy". She next appeared in the comedy <i>God Tussi Great Ho</i>, portraying a TV anchor opposite Salman Khan, Sohail Khan and Amitabh Bachchan. Chopra next starred as a kindergarten teacher in <i>Chamku</i> opposite Bobby Deol and Irrfan Khan, and played the role of Sonia in Goldie Behl's fantasy superhero film <i>Drona</i> opposite Abhishek Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan. <i>Drona</i>, widely criticized for its extensive use of special effects, marked Chopra's sixth film in succession which had failed at both the box-office and critically, although Sukanya Verma of <i>Rediff.com</i> stated that Chopra displayed convincing action heroine skills. Critics generally perceived at this time that her career was over.</p>

<p>The string of poorly received films ended when Chopra starred in Madhur Bhandarkar's <i>Fashion</i>, a drama about the Indian fashion industry which followed the lives and careers of several fashion models. She portrayed the ambitious supermodel Meghna Mathur, a role which she initially thought was out of her depth, but after six months' consideration she accepted the role, inspired by Bhandarkar's confidence in her. For the role, Chopra had to gain 6 kilograms (13lb) and steadily shed the weight during the production as the character progressed in the film. Both the film and her performance received critical acclaim, proving to be a major turning point in her career. Rajeev Masand felt that she "turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best." For her performance, she won several awards, including the National Film Award for Best Actress, the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, the IIFA Award for Best Actress, the Screen Award for Best Actress, and the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.  With a worldwide revenue of ₹600 million (US$8million), <i>Fashion</i> emerged as a commercial success, and was listed by Subhash K. Jha as one of the best films of the decade with women protagonists. It was noted for being commercially successful despite being a women-centric film with no male lead. Chopra said in 2012: "I think actually <i>Fashion</i> kick started... the process of female dominated films. Today you have so many other films which have done well with female leads."</p>

<p>Chopra's final film of the year was Tarun Mansukhani's romantic comedy <i>Dostana</i>, with Abhishek Bachchan and John Abraham. Set in Miami, the film tells the story of a friendship between her character and two men who pretend to be gay to share an apartment with her. Chopra played a stylish young fashion-magazine editor Neha Melwani, who is trying to deal with professional pressures in her life. Produced by Dharma Productions, the film was a financial success with worldwide revenues of over ₹860 million (US$11million). Chopra's performance and look in the film were praised. For her performances in both <i>Fashion</i> and <i>Dostana</i>, she jointly won the Stardust Award for Actor of the Year – Female.</p>

<h3>Experiment with unconventional roles (2009–2011)</h3>
<p>In 2009, Chopra played a feisty Marathi woman named Sweety in Vishal Bhardwaj's caper thriller <i>Kaminey</i> (co-starring Shahid Kapoor), about twin brothers and the journey in their life linked with the underworld. The film received critical acclaim and became successful at the box-office with the worldwide gross earnings of ₹710 million (US$9million). Nikhat Kazmi of <i>The Times of India</i> thought that Chopra's role completely reinvented her, and Rajeev Masand wrote: "Springing a delightful surprise in a smaller part is [Chopra], who sprinkles her lines with a smattering of fluent Marathi and emerges one of the film's most lovable characters." Raja Sen of <i>Rediff.com</i> named Chopra's performance as the best by an actress that year. Her role earned her several awards and nominations, including a second consecutive Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role after <i>Fashion</i> and Best Actress nominations at the Filmfare, Screen and IIFA awards.</p>

<p>Chopra subsequently appeared in Ashutosh Gowariker's romantic comedy <i>What's Your Raashee?</i>, based on the novel <i>Kimball Ravenswood</i> by Madhu Rye. The film depicts the story of a US-based Gujrati NRI in search of his soulmate among 12 girls (all played by Chopra) associated with the 12 zodiac signs. She received a nomination for the Screen Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film. She was considered for inclusion in the <i>Guinness World Records</i> book for being the first film actress to portray 12 distinct characters in one film. Chopra's heavy workload—filming for several productions, travelling for endorsements and performing at live shows (including the Miss India pageant)—took its toll; she fainted during filming, and was admitted to hospital. In 2010, Chopra starred with Uday Chopra in Jugal Hansraj's romantic comedy <i>Pyaar Impossible!</i> as Alisha, a popular college girl (and later a working mother) who falls in love with a socially inept man. Later that year, she starred with Ranbir Kapoor in Siddharth Anand's romantic comedy-drama <i>Anjaana Anjaani</i>. Set in New York and Las Vegas, the film follows the story of two suicidal strangers who fall in love with each other. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success at the box office.</p>

<p>She starred as a femme fatale in her first film of 2011, Vishal Bhardwaj's black comedy <i>7 Khoon Maaf</i>. Based on the short story <i>Susanna's Seven Husbands</i> by Ruskin Bond, <i>7 Khoon Maaf</i> centers on Chopra's Susanna Anna-Marie Johannes, an Anglo-Indian woman who murders her husbands in an unending quest for love. The film and her performance received acclaim from critics. Nikhat Kazmi labelled the film "a milestone in Chopra's career graph", complimenting her "exquisite command over a complex character that is definitely a first in Indian cinema". Rachel Saltz of <i>New York Times</i> felt that Susanna was more conceit than a character and that Chopra "though charming as always, can't make her cohere". Chopra's performance earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress (Critics) and a nomination for the Filmfare Award, IIFA Award, Producers Guild Film Award, and Screen Award for Best Actress.</p>

<p>Chopra's final release of the year saw her reprising her role as Roma in the second installment of the <i>Don</i> franchise, <i>Don 2</i>. Although the film received mixed reviews, Chopra's performance earned positive feedback from critics. According to <i>The Express Tribune</i>, "Chopra... seems to be the perfect choice for an action heroine. As you watch her effortlessly beat up some thugs in the movie, you come to the realization that she may be the first proper female action hero in Bollywood." <i>Don 2</i> was a major success in India and overseas, earning over ₹2.06 billion (US$26million) worldwide.</p>

<h3>Further success (2012–2014)</h3>
<p>Chopra's first film of 2012 was Karan Malhotra's action drama <i>Agneepath</i>, in which she starred with Hrithik Roshan, Sanjay Dutt and Rishi Kapoor. Produced by Karan Johar, the film is a remake of his father's 1990 production of the same name. In one of several accidents to happen during production, Chopra's <i>lehenga</i> (a traditional skirt) caught fire while filming a sequence for an elaborate Ganpati festival song. She featured as Kaali Gawde, Roshan's loquacious love interest in the film. Mayank Shekhar noted how much Chopra stood out in the male-dominated film. <i>Agneepath</i> broke Bollywood's highest opening-day earnings record, and had a worldwide gross of ₹1.93 billion (US$24million). Chopra next co-starred with Shahid Kapoor in Kunal Kohli's romance, <i>Teri Meri Kahaani</i>. The film relates the stories of three unconnected couples (each played by Kapoor and Chopra), born in different eras.</p>

<p>Anurag Basu's <i>Barfi!</i>, with Ranbir Kapoor and Ileana D'Cruz, was her final appearance of 2012. Set in the 1970s, the film tells the story of three people, two of whom are physically disabled. Chopra played Jhilmil Chatterjee, an autistic woman who falls in love with a deaf, mute man (Kapoor). Director Rituparno Ghosh considered it a "very, very brave" role to accept given how demanding it is for an actor to convincingly portray a woman with autism. To prepare for the role, Chopra visited several mental institutions and spent time with autistic people. The film received critical acclaim and was a major commercial success, earning ₹1.75 billion (US$22million) worldwide. Rachit Gupta of <i>Filmfare</i> found Chopra to be the film's "surprise package" and found her performance to be "the best representation of [autism] on Indian celluloid". Pratim D. Gupta of <i>The Telegraph</i> highly praised Kapoor and Chopra, although he found her to be a "tad showy" in her part. Chopra received Best Actress nominations at the Filmfare, Screen, IIFA and Producers Guild Film Awards. The film was chosen as India's entry for the 85th Academy Awards. <i>Agneepath</i> and <i>Barfi!</i> ranked among the highest grossing Bollywood films to that point.</p>

<p>In 2013, she lent her voice to the character of Ishaani, the reigning Pan-Asian champion from India and the love interest of the main protagonist in the Disneytoon Studios film <i>Planes</i>, a spinoff of Pixar's <i>Cars</i> franchise. Chopra, a fan of Disney films, had fun voicing the character saying "The closest I could come to being a Disney princess, I think, was Ishaani". The film was a commercial success, grossing approximately US$240million worldwide. She played an NRI girl in the Apoorva Lakhia's bilingual action drama <i>Zanjeer</i> (<i>Thoofan</i> in Telugu), a remake of the 1973 Hindi film of the same name, which met with poor reactions from critics and was unsuccessful at the box office. Chopra next reprised her role of Priya in Rakesh Roshan's <i>Krrish 3</i>—a sequel to the 2006 superhero film <i>Krrish</i>—with Hrithik Roshan, Vivek Oberoi and Kangana Ranaut. Critics felt that Chopra had very little to do in the film. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV writing that she "is saddled with a sketchily written role and is reduced to the status of a hanger-on waiting for things to unfold". The feature became a box-office success, earning over ₹3 billion (US$38million) worldwide, to become Chopra's biggest commercial success to that point and her fourth major hit in two years. She danced a contemporary mujra in the song "Ram Chahe Leela" for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's <i>Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela.</i></p>

<p>In 2014, Chopra played the lead female role in Yash Raj Films's romantic action drama <i>Gunday</i> directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, alongside Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor and Irrfan Khan. She portrayed Nandita, a cabaret dancer in Calcutta. Set in the 1970s, the film tells the story of two best friends who fall in love with Nandita. <i>Gunday</i> proved to be a box-office success, grossing over ₹1 billion (US$13million) worldwide. Chopra next starred as the title character in <i>Mary Kom</i>, a biographical film of the five time world boxing champion and Olympic bronze medalist Mary Kom. To prepare for the role, she spent time with Kom and received four months of boxing training. The film premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, received positive reviews from critics, and her performance received critical acclaim. Sudhish Kamath from <i>The Hindu</i> criticized the film's screenplay but praised Chopra's "knockout" performance, writing "The spirited actress rises above the material and makes us invest in her and does full justice to the spirit" of the boxer. The Indo-Asian News Service review noted the actress for expressing every shade of the character with "a pitch-perfect bravado". <i>Mary Kom</i> emerged as a commercial success, with revenues of ₹1.04 billion (US$13million) at the box office. She won the Screen Award for Best Actress, the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and received another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.</p>

<h3>Expansion into American film and television (2015–2019)</h3>
<p>In 2015, Chopra starred in Zoya Akhtar's <i>Dil Dhadakne Do</i>, an ensemble comedy-drama. The film tells the story of a dysfunctional Punjabi family (the Mehras), who invite their family and friends on a cruise trip to celebrate the parents' 30th wedding anniversary. She portrayed the role of Ayesha Mehra, a successful entrepreneur and the eldest child. Pratim D. Gupta from <i>The Telegraph</i> wrote of Chopra, "From the propah body language to the measured speech [...] shows the kind of depth she is able to bring to her lines and characters these days. Conversely, Shubhra Gupta of <i>The Indian Express</i> commented that it was time for her "to being a little messy: all these not-a-hair-out-place roles are making her constrained." The cast of <i>Dil Dhadakne Do</i> won the Screen Award for Best Ensemble Cast, and Chopra was nominated for a Screen Award, IIFA Award, and Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress. In 2016, she dubbed for Kaa, a female python, in the Hindi version of the film <i>The Jungle Book</i>.</p>

<p>Chopra signed a talent holding deal with ABC Studios and was later cast in the American thriller series <i>Quantico</i> as the character Alex Parrish. The series premiered in 2015 on ABC, making Chopra the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. The series received positive reviews from television critics and Chopra was praised for her performance. Rob Lowman of the <i>Los Angeles Daily News</i> applauded her "dynamic screen presence" and James Poniewozik of <i>The New York Times</i> named Chopra as the "strongest human asset" of the show, and added that "she is immediately charismatic and commanding." She received the People's Choice Award for Favourite Actress In A New TV Series for her role in <i>Quantico</i>, becoming the first South Asian actress to win a People's Choice Award. The following year, Chopra won a second People's Choice Award for Favorite Dramatic TV Actress. <i>Quantico</i> was cancelled after three seasons in 2018. Chopra later said that her move to America was prompted by disagreements with people in Bollywood: "I had people not casting me, I had beef with people, I am not good at playing that game so I kind of was tired of the politics and I said I needed a break.”</p>

<p>Chopra next portrayed Kashibai, the first wife of the Maratha general Peshwa Bajirao I, in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's epic historical romantic drama <i>Bajirao Mastani</i>. The feature opened to highly positive reviews, and Chopra received widespread praise for her portrayal which several reviewers regarded as her best performance to date. Rajeev Masand wrote "the film benefits from a nice touch of playfulness and humor in Priyanka Chopra's Kashibai. Chopra brings grace to the character, and practically steals the film." Film critic Raja Sen thought that Chopra, despite not being in the title role, owned the film, and wrote "Chopra's terrific in the part, her intelligently expressive eyes speaking volumes and her no-nonsense Marathi rhythm bang-on." A major commercial success, <i>Bajirao Mastani</i> grossed ₹3.5 billion (US$44million) at the box office, becoming one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. For her performance, she won the Filmfare Award, IIFA Award, and Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress, and received a nomination for the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.</p>

<p>In 2016, Chopra starred as a police officer in Prakash Jha's social drama <i>Jai Gangaajal</i>. Writing for <i>The Hindu</i>, Namrata Joshi thought that she "looks off-colour, disinterested and uninvolved with the goings on through most of the film". It did not perform well commercially. The following year, Chopra made her Hollywood live-action film debut by playing the antagonist Victoria Leeds in Seth Gordon's action comedy <i>Baywatch</i> opposite Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. The feature received unfavorable reviews. IGN declared Chopra as the highlight of the film, noting she "outshines pretty much anyone she's in a scene with" and wrote "Chopra's engaging and interesting and is the only character that speaks with any kind of distinctive cadence." Scott Mendelson of <i>Forbes</i> wrote "Chopra has fun as the baddie, but she stays in the background until the end of the movie and really only gets one big scene at the end of the picture." <i>Baywatch</i> was not a commercial success in North America but the film performed well in the overseas markets, grossing approximately $178 million at the worldwide box office. The 2018 Sundance Film Festival marked the release of Chopra's next American film, <i>A Kid Like Jake</i>, a drama about gender variance, starring Jim Parsons and Claire Danes. Amy Nicholson of <i>Variety</i> commended her "charming presence" but thought that her role added little value to the film. In early 2019, she had signed on to play the leading lady opposite Salman Khan in <i>Bharat</i>, but opted out days before filming her scenes. Nikhil Namit, a producer of the film, said that she quit due to her engagement to Nick Jonas and accused her of being "a little unprofessional".</p>

<p>In 2019, Chopra had another supporting part, as a yoga ambassador, in Todd Strauss-Schulson's comedy <i>Isn't It Romantic</i>, which starred Rebel Wilson. The film was well received by critics and grossed approximately $49 million at the North American box office. Dana Schwartz of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> considered her to be "perfectly cast" but Benjamin Lee of <i>The Guardian</i> thought that she was "not quite interesting enough". She returned to Hindi cinema (as Priyanka Chopra Jonas) later in 2019 with Shonali Bose's biographical drama <i>The Sky Is Pink</i>, in which she played mother to Aisha Chaudhary, a teenager suffering from a terminal illness. She also produced the project, and connected with the story for its blend of humour and tragedy. Kate Erbland of IndieWire found her to be "extraordinary" as "the film's driving force, a tough-talking mama bear", and Anna M. M. Vetticad took note of the "simmering restraint" in her performance. The film did not do well at the box office. She received another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.</p>

<p>In 2020, Chopra Jonas signed a multimillion-dollar first-look TV deal with Amazon Prime Video to back content by first time BIPOC and female filmmakers. Her only release that year was the Netflix children's superhero film <i>We Can Be Heroes</i> directed by Robert Rodriguez. She starred as Ms. Granada, the director of a superhero organisation called Heroics. The feature received generally positive reviews; Richard Roeper from the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> praised the actress for "livening up the proceedings" as the strait-laced Ms. Granada, and Ian Freer of the <i>Empire</i> magazine felt that she did the "kids' film acting to the hilt". Her first film of 2021 was Ramin Bahrani's <i>The White Tiger</i>, an adaptation of Aravind Adiga's satirical novel of the same name. She starred alongside Adarsh Gourav and Rajkummar Rao, and also executive produced this Netflix production. Critical reviews towards the film and her performance were positive. Writing for <i>The Times</i>, film critic Kevin Maher deemed Chopra Jonas' performance "impressive" and <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>'s David Rooney commended her for bringing "emotional depth" to her role. The film received a Best Adapted Screenplay nomination at the 93rd Academy Awards. Later that year, Chopra Jonas had a supporting role in the science fiction film <i>The Matrix Resurrections</i>.</p>

<p>Chopra Jonas next starred alongside Richard Madden in Amazon Prime Video's action thriller series <i>Citadel</i> (2023). With a production budget of US$300 million, the six-episode first season ranks as one of the most-expensive television shows. It marked the first time in her career when she received equal pay with her male co-star. She performed many of her own stunts, and suffered a permanent scar from an injury on her eyebrow. Critics had mixed opinions on the series, but Jasper Rees of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> was particularly impressed by Chopra Jonas' potential as a female James Bond, finding her "flirty and funny and hard as a bag of nine-inch nails". She then led the romantic comedy <i>Love Again</i>, opposite Sam Heughan and Celine Dion, which was panned by critics.</p>

<p>Chopra Jonas will next star alongside John Cena and Idris Elba in the action film <i>Heads of State</i>.</p>




<h2>Music career</h2>
<p>Chopra's main vocal influence was her father, who helped develop her interest in singing. She used her vocal talent early in her pageantry career. Her first recording, the song "Ullathai Killathe" in the Tamil film <i>Thamizhan</i> (2002), was made at the urging of her director and co-star, Vijay (who had noticed her singing on the set). She declined to sing playback for "Tinka Tinka" in her film <i>Karam</i> (2005), preferring to concentrate on her acting career, but later sang the song live on the television programme <i>Sa Re Ga Ma Pa</i>. Chopra recorded an unreleased song for <i>Bluffmaster!</i> (2005). In August 2011, Universal Music Group signed Chopra to a worldwide recording agreement with DesiHits. The deal indicated that her first studio album would be released by Interscope Records in North America and by Island Records elsewhere.</p>

<p>In July 2012, Chopra became the first Bollywood star signed by Creative Artists Agency, an entertainment and sports agency based in Los Angeles. The album was produced by RedOne. Her first single, "In My City", debuted in the US on 13 September 2012 in a TV spot for the NFL Network's Thursday Night Football; a shortened version of the song was used to open each show of the season. "In My City" features rapper will.i.am; according to Chopra, a co-writer, the song was inspired by her unsettled childhood and her journey from a small-town girl to a celebrity. The song received mixed reviews from critics, and was a commercial success in India; it sold more than 130,000copies in its first week, topped the Hindi pop chart and was certified triple platinum. In the United States the single was unsuccessful, with 5,000digital downloads in its first week according to Nielsen SoundScan, and did not receive radio play. In October 2012, the single won her the Best International Debut award at the People's Choice Awards India. In December 2012, she received three nominations: Best Female Artist, Best Song and Best Video (for "In My City") at the World Music Awards. Chopra was also featured on "Erase", an EDM song produced by the American DJ and producer duo The Chainsmokers.</p>

<p>In July 2013, Chopra released her second single "Exotic" featuring American rapper Pitbull, along with its music video. "Exotic" debuted at number 16 on the <i>Billboard</i> Dance/Electronic Songs and number11 on the Dance/Electronic Digital Songs chart on 27 July 2013 issue.

She recorded a promotional song for <i>Ventilator</i> (2016), making her Marathi language playback singing debut with "Baba". In 2017, Chopra collaborated with the Australian DJ Will Sparks for "Young and Free", an EDM song which she also wrote. Chopra later said that her music career "was not living up to my standards" and that it would have been "futile" to have kept pursuing it.</p>



<h2>Philanthropy</h2>
<p>Chopra supports various causes through her foundation "The Priyanka Chopra Foundation for Health and Education", which works towards providing support to unprivileged children across the country in the areas of Education and Health. She donates ten percent of her earnings to fund the foundation's operations, and pays for educational and medical expenses for seventy children in India, fifty among whom are girls. She often speaks out on women's issues: against female infanticide and foeticide, and in support of education for girls. A believer in feminism, Chopra has always been vocal about women's rights, gender equality, and gender pay gap. In 2006, a "day with Chopra" was auctioned on eBay; the proceeds were donated to an NGO, Nanhi Kali, which helps educate girls in India. She has made appearances in support of other charities, such as the 2005 HELP! Telethon Concert to raise funds for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.</p>

<p>She has worked with UNICEF since 2006, recording public-service announcements and participating in media panel discussions promoting children's rights and the education of girls, and also participated in celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. She was appointed as the national UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Child Rights on 10 August 2010. UNICEF Representative Karin Hulshof said of the appointment: "She is equally passionate about her work on behalf of children and adolescents. We are proud of the work she has done with us so far on child rights, and, we are thrilled about all what we will be doing together so that no child gets left behind." In 2009, she shot a documentary for the organisation Alert India to increase understanding of leprosy.

In 2012 Chopra spoke at the launch of Awakening Youth, an anti-addiction programme.</p>

<p>At a public event in 2019, an activist criticised Chopra for a tweet in which she hailed India's military forces while tensions amid Pakistan and India were escalating. The main line of argument was that she was warmongering and that was incompatible with her job as UN Peace Ambassador. Chopra's response at the event was that she is patriotic; she was also fast to silence the activist criticising her. Pakistan asked for Chopra being sacked from her UN job but UN supported Chopra's right to talk for herself.</p>

She said after her first year of writing: "I'm a private person and never thought that I could express my feelings. But strangely enough, whenever I sat down to write this column, my inner most thoughts came to the fore." In March 2009, she met several readers who had submitted feedback on her weekly column. She continued to write sporadically for newspapers. In August 2012 she wrote a column published in <i>The Times of India</i> titled "No woman in Mumbai feels safe any longer", discussing the murder of 25-year-old Pallavi Purkayastha, whom she met while working on <i>Don</i>.

She writes, it seems, to connect. The experience feels intimate, like Chopra Jonas is exchanging stories with a friend over coffee. Her stories are exceedingly personal, and despite being an international movie star, many of them even feel relatable." <i>Unfinished</i> reached <i>The New York Times</i> Best Seller list in the United States.</p>
