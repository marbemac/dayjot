<h1><i>Guts</i> (Olivia Rodrigo album)</h1>


<div>2023 studio albumby Olivia Rodrigo</div>

<p><i><b>Guts</b></i> (stylized in all caps) is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo, released on September 8, 2023, via Geffen Records. It was written and recorded with Rodrigo working closely alongside Dan Nigro, the producer and multi-instrumentalist of her debut album <i>Sour</i> (2021). Inspired by the period of time immediately following <i>Sour</i>'s success, Rodrigo conceived <i>Guts</i> hoping to reflect the process of maturity she experienced toward the end of her teenage years.</p>

<p>A sonically diverse pop record with energetic songs and soft ballads, <i>Guts</i> experiments with more rock influences than its predecessor, utilizing a variety of guitar and drum sounds from older alternative and pop rock styles. The subject matter deals with Rodrigo's transition from adolescence to adulthood and its tribulations. </p>

<p>Met with widespread acclaim from music critics, <i>Guts</i> was praised for Rodrigo's lyrical wit, complexity, and topicality as well as the overall music aesthetic and energy. Reviews noted both humorous and emotionally fraught lyrics in the album, detailing Rodrigo's struggles with identity, romantic and professional disillusionment, unexpected stardom, and societal expectations as a young woman.</p>

<p>Commercially, <i>Guts</i> topped the album charts in 14 countries, including the United States, Australia, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In its US debut, it recorded 302,000 first-week album-equivalent units while charting all 12 of its songs in the Top 40 of the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Three singles were released from the album, including the international number-one track "Vampire" and the top-10 charting "Bad Idea Right?" and "Get Him Back!" To further support the album, Rodrigo will embark on the Guts World Tour in 2024.</p>



<h2>Background</h2>
<p>On May 21, 2021, Olivia Rodrigo released her debut studio album, <i>Sour</i>, to huge commercial success. Produced by Dan Nigro, it became the most-streamed album of 2021 and won Rodrigo three Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist. She embarked on the Sour Tour, which consisted of 48 shows across North America and Europe, in spring 2022. In August 2021, Rodrigo surmised that her upcoming record would probably "be a lot happier" than her debut. Talking to <i>Billboard</i> in February 2022, she confirmed Nigro will return as producer and she had a title and "a few songs" ready. Rodrigo aimed to "get as much done as possible" before embarking on the Sour Tour. In late 2022, while revealing her Spotify Wrapped, she confirmed that new music was underway. On January 8, 2023, she posted a clip which featured a piano-driven track on her Instagram.</p>

<p>In early June 2023, Rodrigo's website was updated with a countdown that was set to end on June 30, a date she had also teased in late May. On June 13, Rodrigo officially announced the album's lead single "Vampire", slated for release on June 30, and revealed the single cover. On June 20, she revealed another Easter egg by leaving her fans a voicemail greeting, which turned out to be the first preview of "Vampire" and played a piano-driven instrumental. On June 26, 2023, her webstore revealed the official album title, <i>Guts</i>, and its release date. Following this, Rodrigo posted the artwork and officially announced the album on social media.</p> 



<h2>Writing and recording</h2>
<p>In a statement, Rodrigo shared that the album is about "growing pains" and figuring out her identity at this point in her life. She stated "I feel like I grew 10 years between the ages of 18 and 20", and described it as a natural part of "growth", and hoped to reflect that with the record.</p>

<p>Rodrigo recorded <i>Guts</i> while experiencing "lots of confusion, mistakes, awkwardness &amp; good old fashioned teen angst". Described by her as a "time capsule", the record contains "wrenching, cinematic" ballads and "playful and insouciant" songs, according to <i>Vogue</i>. Rodrigo abstained from songwriting for six months following <i>Sour</i>'s release, so that she could "live a life in order to be able to write about it". Work on the album concluded about a week before "Vampire" was released. In an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, Rodrigo revealed she had the title in mind since the time she was making <i>Sour</i>. It was influenced by the "interesting contexts" she noticed people use it in: "spill your guts, hate your guts".</p>



<h2>Music</h2>
<p><i>Guts</i> features a sonically diverse range of tracks, from delicate ballads like "Lacy" to retro-inspired guitar-driven tunes such as "Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl". 
Rodrigo's collaboration with Nigro played a significant role in the album's development, providing constructive feedback and contributing to its overall sound. According to <i>The A.V. Club</i>, <i>Guts</i> offers a mix of nostalgic and contemporary music elements, helping in the album's appeal with a wide audience.</p>

<p>Rock music plays a larger role on <i>Guts</i> than on <i>Sour</i>, expanding on the aggressive and alternative rock sounds demonstrated briefly on Rodrigo's first album. As <i>Los Angeles Times</i> lead critic Mikael Wood writes, Rodrigo and Nigro are shown "switching up guitar tones and drum sounds to give each track a distinct signature", with elements from emo, new wave, shoegaze, and rap rock used on different songs. In particular, songs such as "All-American Bitch" and "Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl" are performed in pop-punk modes, while "Love Is Embarrassing" and "Lacy" incorporate new wave and dramatic folk sounds, respectively. Overall, <i>Rolling Stone</i> journalist Brian Hiatt and <i>Vulture</i> writer Craig Jenkins both regard <i>Guts</i> as a rock album and argue that such a strong direction into the genre is uncommon for a major pop artist like Rodrigo.</p>

<p>In another comparison to <i>Sour</i>, <i>The A.V. Club</i> identifies much older sources of inspiration behind <i>Guts</i>, particularly the grunge and pop-rock sounds of the 1990s and early 2000s. <i>Line of Best Fit</i> writer Matthew Kim notices "frequent musical inspiration" from the "pop punk and garage rock revival" of the turn of the 21st century, connecting this to Rodrigo's birth around this time and subsequent listening of her parents' alternative rock collection. Along with grunge and new wave, Jenkins also names power pop among the stylistic tactics behind the album's sentimental ballads and alternative rockers. Echoing this, Will Hodgkinson of <i>The Times</i> says that the album alternates "between heartfelt balladry and raucous indie rock". "Vampire", which begins as a hushed piano ballad, intensifies into a rock opera.</p>

<h3>Lyrics</h3>
<p>Rodrigo's lyrics throughout <i>Guts</i> focus on her transition from adolescence to adulthood, exploring struggles with identity, sudden stardom, romance, and societal expectations as a young woman. According to Jenkins, the Joan Didion-referencing opener "All-American Bitch" introduces a world of "restrictive societal mores and beauty standards" that Rodrigo navigates throughout the album while in search of "meaningful companionship in a field of layabouts, liars, and social climbers".</p>

<p>Likening <i>Guts</i> conceptually to Billie Eilish's <i>Happier Than Ever</i> (2021), another record that explores the repercussions of fame, Wood observes how "Rodrigo intertwines her tales of social-professional disillusionment with stories of romantic betrayal". Rodrigo admires a rival as a "dazzling starlet" on "Lacy", which along with "The Grudge" is interpreted by Wood to be "about what appear to be her frayed relationships with two of her musical idols", Gracie Abrams and Taylor Swift, respectively. Both songs, Wood muses, also adapt the stylistic influence of their purported subject. Veteran critic Robert Christgau analyzes that, ultimately, the "defining complication" of the album's lyrics is the low chance Rodrigo has of meeting "anyone as smart, decent, successful, and hilarious as she is on the party circuit her well-earned fame opens up to her and sticks her with".</p>

<p>Speaking on the stylistic connections to the album's subject matter, Jenkins recognizes a "brusque, confident" tone in the rockers, while lyrics about insecurity and maltreatment are revealed in "wounded ballads". <i>Clash</i> magazine's Alex Barry says Rodrigo's narratives are generally marked by complex, verbose lyrics delivered in a "fast talk-singing" style. Meanwhile, BBC journalist Nick Levine observes "emotionally charged" pop-rock songs reflective of both Rodrigo's Generation Z peers and older generations. On songs such as "Get Him Back!" and "Bad Idea Right?", both satires of Gen Z dating behaviors, Rodrigo employs different tonal inflections and an expansion of the sense of humor "merely hinted at" on <i>Sour</i>, according to Wood: "You can hear her actor's background in pitch-perfect line readings that shift between comic registers on a dime â€” from naturalistic to screwball, faux-earnest to deadpan". "Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl" offers a candid portrayal of social awkwardness, drawing from Rodrigo's experience being homeschooled as a teenager.</p>



<h2>Release and promotion</h2>
<p><i>Guts</i> was released on September 8, 2023, via CD, cassette, and streaming platforms, as well as three box set editions. Preorders for the album began on June 26, 2023. Vinyl LPs, in various colored variants, were also released, each of which were exclusively available at Rodrigo's webstore, Urban Outfitters, Walmart, Amazon, or HMV. A Target-exclusive CD and vinyl edition of <i>Guts</i> featuring an alternate cover was also available upon release. Each of a set of four bonus songs appeared as a 13th "hidden track" on each of the limited-edition vinyl variants from Rodrigo's webstore.</p>

<h3>Cover artwork</h3>
<p>Photographed by Larissa Hoffman, the standard cover artwork of <i>Guts</i> depicts Rodrigo reclining on a purple floor, biting her thumb, while wearing a frilly black dress and scarlet lipstick, with four letter rings spelling out the album title on her fingers; her nails are painted with chipped black nail polish. Like her debut album <i>Sour</i>, purpleâ€”this time in a darker shadeâ€”is again the dominant color through the artwork and promotional material of <i>Guts</i>.</p>

<h3>Singles</h3>
<p>"Vampire", the lead single of <i>Guts</i>, was released on June 30, 2023, via streaming platforms, 7-inch, and CD single formats; the latter two additionally feature a demo version of the song. An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Petra Collins in L.A., was uploaded to Rodrigo's YouTube channel simultaneously with the single's release. The song debuted atop the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, marking her third number-one. It also topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom; where it also became her third leader.</p>

<p>"Bad Idea Right?" was announced as the second single via Rodrigo's social media on August 8, 2023, and was released four days later. She stated that the song "shows another side of <i>Guts</i> that's a little more fun &amp; playful". Collins directed the music video for this song as well. It reached the top 10 in Australia, the US, and UK. The song also landed atop the <i>Billboard</i> Hot Rock &amp; Alternative Songs chart.</p> 

<p>"Get Him Back!" impacted Italian radio as the third single on September 15, 2023. Its music video was filmed on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and released on September 12, 2023. The song peaked within the top 10 on the <i>Billboard</i> Global 200, and in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the UK.</p>

<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>The album's tracklist was teased via a video clip released on July 31, 2023, which included clues intended for fans to decode. It featured Rodrigo relaxing in a bedroom, unpacking boxes, and experimenting with various devices, including an electric keyboard and a retro typewriter. Rodrigo revealed the tracklist the day after. She released a trailer for the album on September 7, 2023, which parodied an infomercial and featured narration by Mort Crim. The video revealed the four "hidden tracks" of the album. A website dedicated to the album was also launched. A pop-up experience in partnership with American Express and Spotify, entitled the "<i>Guts</i> Gallery", ran from September 8 through September 10 in the Meatpacking District, Manhattan of New York City; it featured <i>Guts</i>-themed activations, photo ops, and exclusive merchandise. The pop-up privately commenced a day earlier for select American Express cardholders and Spotify fans, wherein Rodrigo appeared to preview four songs and for the Q&amp;A segment; it was moderated by fashion editor Eva Chen.</p> 

<p>Rodrigo appeared on the magazine covers of <i>Vogue</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and <i>Interview</i>. She performed "Vampire" and "Get Him Back!" on <i>Today</i> and the <i>Live Lounge</i>, and at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards. An intimate one-off concert, An Evening With Olivia Rodrigo, took place on October 9 at the Theatre at Ace Hotel to an audience of 1,600 people, wherein Rodrigo performed music from <i>Guts</i> including acoustic renditions. She was joined by producer Dan Nigro for a Q&amp;A and conversation segment in which they answered fan-submitted questions on and discussed the album's creation. The concert was announced the day before with tickets exclusively available to American Express cardholders. Proceeds from ticket sales benefited Rodrigo's nonprofit, Fund 4 Good, which supports organizations that "champion girls' education, support reproductive rights and prevent gender-based violence". The concert was filmed and uploaded to stream from October 10 through October 12 on Rodrigo's YouTube channel.</p>

<p>Rodrigo appeared and also performed "Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl" on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> on October 24.</p>

<p>She will perform music from <i>Guts</i> at the 2023 iterations of iHeartRadio's annual KIIS-FM Jingle Ball and Z100's Jingle Ball in December.</p>

<h3>Tour</h3>
<p>On September 13, 2023, Rodrigo announced her second concert tour, the Guts World Tour, in support of the album. Consisting of 75 dates across North America and Europe, the tour will start on February 23, 2024 in Palm Springs and conclude on August 17, 2024, in Inglewood, California. The Breeders, Chappell Roan, PinkPantheress, and Remi Wolf will feature as supporting acts. Before its announcement, the tour and its first show were teased in an Easter egg in the lyric video for the track "Making the Bed". Rodrigo stated she wrote <i>Guts</i> "with a tour in mind, so I think they're all songs I wanted people to be able to scream in a crowd". A portion of proceeds from ticket sales will go to the Fund 4 Good initiative.</p>

<p><i>Guts</i> was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score out of 100 to ratings from professional publications, it received a weighted mean score of 91, based on 22 reviews. Rob Sheffield of <i>Rolling Stone</i> hailed the album as an "instant classic" and the work of "a truly brilliant rock star", with some of Rodrigo's "most ambitious, intimate, and messy songs yet", proving she is "a voice that's here to stay and a songwriter built to last." Offering similar praise, <i>Billboard</i> magazine's Jason Lipshutz called it "the most complete pop album of the year". Its musical aesthetic was hailed by Christgau as a "triumph", while <i>The New York Times</i> reviewer Jon Caramanica deemed it "poignantly fraught" and "agitated" with an energy that matches the spirit of Rodrigo's narratives. <i>The New Yorker</i>'s Carrie Battan found its alternative-leaning cross-section of revivalist pop-punk and piano ballads shrewd, thoughtfully constructed, and fitting with the rebellious cheek and yearning melodrama reflected in the music's tone.</p>

<p>Several reviewers noted the wit to the lyrics. <i>The Guardian</i>'s Alexis Petridis found the record "sharp and witty", and Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of <i>Financial Times</i> called it "quick-witted post-Taylor-Swift pop" with "emo-adjacent pop-punk and bombast-free ballads". In her review for <i>The Independent</i>, Helen Brown deemed it "wittier" and "angrier" than <i>Sour</i>. Conversely, Poppie Platt of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> wrote a mixed review, which said <i>Guts</i> was mostly a mere continuation of her first album with little musical or lyrical growth.</p>

<p>Other reviewers were impressed by the complexity and credibility of Rodrigo's performance. Calling the album a "masterpiece", Wood found the lyrics emotionally convincing and connected it to Swift's overall influence on Rodrigo: "This talent for embodying various sides of her character feels like a defining attribute of <i>Guts</i>". Christgau noted the "psychological complexity", persuasive characterization, and amusing humor in her portraying the tribulations of a young popstar, concluding that "she's so damn good at what she does". Concluding her review for AllMusic, Heather Phares proclaimed <i>Guts</i> to be a testament to Rodrigo's artistic confidence, eloquence, and ability to translate complex emotions into music with broad appeal.</p>



<h2>Commercial performance</h2>

<p>In the United States, <i>Guts</i> debuted at number one on <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart, earning 302,000 album-equivalent units (including 150,000 in pure album sales) in its first week, approximately 7,000 more units than her debut. It became Rodrigo's second album to top the chart. The album also accumulated a total of 199.59 million on-demand streams of the album's songs, with all 12 tracks charting in the top 40 of the Hot 100, including a return to the number-one spot for "Vampire".</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom, the album landed at the top on the UK Albums Chart with 60,300 units, scoring Rodrigo's second number-one album in the country and surpassing <i>Sour</i>'s first week sales with roughly 10,000 more units. It also had the fourth highest entry on the chart in 2023, outselling the entirety of the top 10 combined.</p>  

<p>In Australia, the album debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart, her second number one in the country, whilst all the tracks debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart. "Vampire" and "Bad Idea Right?" rose to the Top 3. <i>Guts</i> entered at the number one spot of the New Zealand Albums Chart, becoming her second consecutive number-one album.</p>
