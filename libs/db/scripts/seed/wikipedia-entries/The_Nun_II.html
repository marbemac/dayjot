<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>In 1956, Father Noiret and young Jacques perform their daily chores in their church in Tarascon, France. While investigating a disturbance, Noiret is raised into the air, set on fire, and burned to death before a terrified Jacques flees.</p>

<p>Four years following the events at Saint Cartha's monastery, Sister Irene now serves in a convent in Italy. Maurice works at a boarding school in France, where he has befriended a young Irish student named Sophie and her teacher and mother, Kate. Irene has a vision of Maurice asking her to save him. She is dispatched by the Cardinal to investigate a series of deaths across Europe, attributed to the demon Valak, due to her previous experience with the demon. She travels to Tarascon with Sister Debra, a young novice who expresses her difficulty in accepting miracles, such as the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Meanwhile, a delivery girl witnesses Valak talking to a possessed Maurice before Valak kills her.</p>

<p>In Tarascon, Irene is haunted by Valak and has a strange vision. Sister Debra tells Irene that she received Noiret's rosary from Jacques. At school, Sophie is bullied by classmates and locked in the deconsecrated sealed-off chapel. The bully points out the goat on the stained-glass window, claiming the devil appears when the sun shines through and turns the goat's eyes red. One night, the headmistress encounters a sleepwalking Maurice and is killed by Valak in the guise of her deceased son.</p>

<p>Irene and Debra travel to the Palais des Papes and meet with a librarian. He explains that Valak was an angel rejected by God and the emblem on Noiret's rosary is the family crest of St. Lucy, who was martyred by a pagan. Though she was set on fire, she miraculously did not burn; her eyes were gouged out, but her family recovered them. The librarian suggests the demon is killing St. Lucy's descendants because it wants this powerful relic, last known to be stored in a former monastery-turned-winery. The winery then became the present-day boarding school.</p>

<p>At the school, Irene and Debra face off against a fully possessed Maurice. Sophie shows the women the stained-glass goat in the chapel and they use a flashlight to make its eyes glow red. The red light acts as a laser, pointing to where the eyes of St. Lucy are buried. Irene finds the relic and the stained-glass goat vanishes, reappearing in real life as a demonic creature.</p>

<p>As the goat attacks the students, Maurice attacks Irene, chases Sophie, and causes the bell tower to collapse. Debra admits to Irene that she now has faith. Irene uses the relic against Maurice, but he grabs it, causing Valak to appear. Similar to Father Noiret, Valak lifts Irene in the air and sets her ablaze. Irene does not burn as Valak realizes she is a descendant of St. Lucy, able to harness the same power associated with the relic. Irene and Debra pray, with faith, the Words of Institution used in Christian celebrations of the Eucharist and the old barrels of wine in the room become the blood of Christ, banishing the demon. With Valak gone, Irene and Debra managed to free Maurice of possession and save his life.</p>

<p>The next morning, Irene leads Maurice outside and helps him to regain his senses. However, she becomes concerned as she watches him going with Sophie and Kate inside.</p>

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>In August 2017, Wan discussed the possibility of a <i>Nun</i> sequel and what its story may be: "I do know where potentially, if <i>The Nun</i> works out, where <i>The Nun 2</i> could lead to and how that ties back to Lorraine's story that we've set up with the first two <i>Conjuring</i>s and make it all come full circle."</p>

<p>In April 2019, it was announced by Peter Safran that a sequel was in development. Safran stated that there was a "really fun" storyline planned for the film and commented that there was an "inevitability to another <i>The Nun</i> movie".

<h3>Critical response</h3>
<p>On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 52% of 130 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10.The website's consensus reads: "Scarier than its predecessor, <i>The Nun II</i> makes for an entertaining addition to the <i>Conjuring</i> franchise despite not being the most original horror sequel." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 47 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 64% overall positive score, with 47% saying they would definitely recommend the film.</p>

<p>Frank Scheck of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> wrote, "The filmmaker does a fine job creating a suitably ominous atmosphere (the old-world European locations and Tristan Nyby's gloomy cinematography really help) and orchestrates the violent mayhem, much of it involving terrified little girls, with disturbing relish." <i>The Times</i>'s Ed Potton gave the film 3/5 stars, saying it "often flirts with ridiculousness", but praised Chaves's direction, Farmiga and Downey's performances and the finale. CNN's Brian Lowry called the film "a slick if familiar addition to the very fertile <i>Conjuring</i> universe that, by deftly expanding on the 2018 hit, appears destined to become another cinematic habit." Dennis Harvey of <i>Variety</i> wrote, "In some respects an improvement on its predecessor, in others not, this is finally one more good-enough if unmemorable entry sure to extend the series' life in lucrative fashion."</p>

<p>Bob Smithouser of <i>Plugged In</i> stated that "<i>The Nun II</i> is one of the purest cinematic versions of palpable image over substance that I've seen in some time." Claire Shaffer of <i>The New York Times</i> said the film "runs like haunted clockwork, shoving characters down dark alleyways or abandoned chapels every five minutes with little justification. Scene after scene builds fear and tension, and then a monster appears, and then … not much else, in most cases." <i>The Sydney Morning Herald'</i>s Jake Wilson gave it 2/5 stars, writing, "The shocks are brief and not too grisly, the dingy Gothic look is as you'd expect, and the mechanical climax steers clear of the more unsettling possibilities that might have emerged if Frenchie's Jekyll and Hyde sides had been meaningfully linked." Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press gave it 1/5 stars, writing, "A new directing and writing team fails to shock or scare with a color-by-numbers plot and a meandering, languid wannabe frightfest."</p>
