Grimes is self-taught in music and visual art.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[After nine days] you have no stimulation, so your subconscious starts filling in the blanks ... I started to feel like I was channelling spirits. I was convinced my music was a gift from God. It was like I knew exactly what to do next, as if my songs were already written.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grimes in <i>The Guardian</i>, April 27, 2012</p>
</div><p> The album's second single, "Oblivion", was named the best song of 2012 by <i>Pitchfork</i> and was produced into a music video co-directed by Emily Kai Bock and Grimes. <i>Pitchfork</i> ranked "Oblivion" at number one on their 200 Best Tracks of the Decade So Far list in 2014. In interviews following the album's release, Grimes explained that she was assigned a strict deadline by which to have her third album finished far before it was complete, resulting in her recording the bulk of <i>Visions</i> while isolated in her Montreal apartment for three consecutive weeks. Notably, this intensive recording session included a period of nine days without sleep or food and with blacked out windows, since she generally could not make music as readily during the day, and doing "tons of amphetamines" She described the writing process as being "equally enjoyable and tortuous", feeling that its difficulty contributed to its success. Grimes went on the Visions Tour from 2012 to 2014 with supporting acts Born Gold, Myths, Elite Gymnastics, and Ami Dang. In March 2012, Grimes collaborated with Cop Car Bonfire's Tim Lafontaine and went under the name, Membrain. They released an EP called, <i>Sit Back, Rewind</i>.

In December 2013, Grimes employed the services of Jay-Z's management company, Roc Nation.</p>

<h2>Artistry</h2>
<h3>Musical style</h3>
<img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/GrimesHardRockCafeMakati.jpg/220px-GrimesHardRockCafeMakati.jpg" height="146" width="220" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/GrimesHardRockCafeMakati.jpg/330px-GrimesHardRockCafeMakati.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/GrimesHardRockCafeMakati.jpg/440px-GrimesHardRockCafeMakati.jpg 2x" /> Grimes at Hard Rock Cafe Makati in 2013
<p>Grimes' music has been described with a number of labels, including synth-pop, electropop, art pop, indie pop, dream pop, experimental pop, pop, avant-garde pop, lo-fi, dance, witch house, electronic, glo-fi, bedroom pop, and electronica with elements of rock, hip hop, R&amp;B, folk, drum and bass, and classical.</p>

<p>According to <i>Vulture</i>, "[Grimes moved away] from the creepy, lo-fi R&amp;B of her early releases to the futuristic dance-pop of her...[third] album, <i>Visions</i>." For her fourth studio, <i>Art Angels</i>, Grimes learned how to play guitar and violin. She stated "I didn't want to play the keys, 'cause I don't want to be considered synth-pop." <i>Rolling Stone</i> described the album as a "[move away from her] hazy synth-pop toward an off-kilter guitars-and-beats sound," and "uses rock sounds in a really different context." Grimes described her fifth studio album <i>Miss Anthropocene</i> as "mostly ethereal nu metal." <i>The Guardian</i> summarised her musical style: "By sounding a little like everything you've ever heard, the whole sounds like nothing you've ever heard." <i>The Japan Times</i> wrote that Grimes' "otherworldly, Ableton-assisted music is crammed full of hooks fit to sit alongside Rihanna and Taylor Swift in the Top 40". <i>Dazed</i> stated: "In a sense, she'd always thrived on being too pop for indie and too indie for pop". Her lyrics were described by <i>The Guardian</i> as "generally elusive and impressionistic, shying away from specifics". Grimes is a soprano. <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> described her vocals as "sweet, thin and hazy." She utilizes looping and layering techniques, particularly with vocals; many of her songs feature layers of over fifty different vocal tracks which create an "ethereal" sound. Her lyrical themes include science fiction, feminism, and climate change. Her fifth studio album <i>Miss Anthropocene</i> has been considered to be a loose concept album about an "anthropomorphic goddess of climate change" inspired by Roman mythology and villainy. Heather Phares of AllMusic described the album as a "brooding embodiment of climate change." In the single "So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth" she also experimented with AI-generated music using the NSynth neural synthesizer.</p>

<p>Grimes described her music as "ADD music", shifting frequently and dramatically – "I go through phases a lot." She said "Most music with traditional verse, chorus and bridge structures can probably be considered 'pop.' But I think most people think about Top 40 these days when they use the word 'pop,' and I'm emphatically not from that world." She said that Panda Bear's 2007 album <i>Person Pitch</i> "jumpstarted" her mind. She explains, "Up until that point I had basically only made weird atonal drone music, with no sense of songwriting. I barely understood anything about music ... But suddenly all music clicked into place and seemed so simple and easy. I was pretty much able to spontaneously write songs immediately after listening to this album once."</p>

<h3>Influences</h3>
<p>Her work has been likened to various artists, including Björk, Julianna Barwick, Siouxsie Sioux, and Enya. She has stated that she loves British rock bands like Bring Me the Horizon and Foals. She was described by <i>Tastemakers Magazine</i> as an "alien love-child of Aphex Twin and ABBA". While making her third studio album, Grimes was listening to Aphex Twin, Black Dice, Dungeon Family, Michael Jackson, New Edition, Outkast, Nine Inch Nails, Burial, TLC, Mariah Carey and stated "I'm into the really caustic beats, the kind of sharp drum and bass kind of stuff. Really nice vocals too, with lots of tight harmonies at the same time."</p>

<p>Grimes cites Blink-182 as an influence in her Amoeba Records "What's In My Bag?" episode where she picked one of their live DVDs. Grimes considers Blue Hawaii "a big part of my family in Montreal." Grimes stated that Cocteau Twins are "one of the first bands I was into that was considered alternative." In a tweet, Grimes replied to someone saying that her recent influences were Chris Isaak, St. Vincent, and Mindless Self Indulgence. The theories of her second studio album, <i>Halfaxa</i> were inspired by Hildegard of Bingen.</p>

<p>Before releasing her fourth studio album, <i>Art Angels</i>, Grimes described one of her upcoming songs as a glam rock track inspired by David Bowie and Queen. <i>Art Angels</i> was also influenced by Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen, and <i>The Godfather</i> movies. Grimes said that while touring with How to Dress Well, his song "Suicide Dream 2" "made me tear up every night... [and] after this tour I got really re-inspired, went home, and immediately wrote [songs that] are, in my opinion, the best shit I've ever done." Early on, Grimes stated that "an early diet of the Spice Girls, Marilyn Manson, OutKast and Skinny Puppy drove her to build pop songs out of the harsher sonic textures she rarely heard on the radio." Some of her other influences include Jedi Mind Tricks, Kenji Kawai, Yoko Kanno, Alicia Keys, Panda Bear, Bikini Kill, Kate Bush, Al Green, Salem, Trent Reznor, Tool, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Paramore.</p>

<h3>Visual art</h3>
<p>Grimes designs her album art for all of her albums, gig fliers, comic book covers, and merchandise. She has done exhibitions showcasing her works and has stated that "[she has] always been a visual artist". Her art is influenced by Japanese anime, manga, and comic artists such as Charles Burns and Daniel Clowes. Her illustrations have appeared in gallery shows, including at Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. She created an alternate cover for Image Comics' <i>The Wicked + The Divine</i>, and designed a capsule collection of t-shirts for Hedi Slimane's Saint Laurent, in 2013. That year, she also curated a two-day event at the Audio Visual Arts Gallery in New York City with a silent auction to benefit the Native Women's Association of Canada's campaign to raise awareness of violence against aboriginal women in Canada. In early 2021, she sold original digital art in the form of non-fungible tokens for $5.8 million. In May 2022, she said on Twitter she was joining the board of Unicorn DAO, "to help their mission to fund/ develop female and non-binary lead art and projects."</p>



<h2>Personal life</h2>
<p>Grimes’ family includes brother Mac Boucher, who has played a role in creating a number of her music videos including "Violence," "Go," "Realiti," and "Venus Fly," among others; and a step-brother who raps under the name Jay Worthy; they collaborated on the single "Christmas Song", released on the Rough Trade bonus disc of her <i>Visions</i> album.</p> 

<p>In 2009, Grimes and a friend attempted to sail down the Mississippi River to New Orleans from Minneapolis in a houseboat they built. Following several mishaps, including engine trouble and encounters with law enforcement, the houseboat was impounded by the city of Minneapolis. Grimes claims that elements of the story were exaggerated in the newspapers that reported on it at the time. The adventure has been turned into an animated video narrated by T-Bone Burnett.</p>

<p>Grimes has been open about her past drug usage, revealing intense periods during the creation of her third album, <i>Visions</i> in 2012, during which she "blacked out the windows and did tons of amphetamine and stayed up for three weeks and didn't eat anything." In 2014, she wrote a blog post expressing her aversion to hard drugs.</p>

<p>Grimes embraces her distinctive lisp and has expressed no desire for speech therapy to alter it. Grimes has stated that she is autistic, saying she was previously misdiagnosed with restless legs syndrome and schizoaffective disorder. She described personal motor-skill issues when "[she] went to check [her] kids and performed worse than them on every test".</p>

<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>From 2007 to 2010, Grimes was in an on-and-off relationship with Devon Welsh, then lead vocalist of Majical Cloudz. The two met in 2007 at a first-year dorm party while studying at McGill University. From 2012 to 2018, Grimes was in a relationship with electronic musician Jaime Brooks, who supported her on the Visions Tour performing as Elite Gymnastics.</p>

<p>In 2018, Grimes began a relationship with business magnate Elon Musk. They met after discovering on Twitter that they both came up with the same pun relating to Rococo and the thought experiment Roko's basilisk. In 2020, Grimes gave birth to their son, and in 2021, they welcomed a daughter via surrogacy.
Grimes said via Instagram that Go Won of the South Korean girl group Loona, with whom she collaborated in 2018, is her eldest son's godmother. The couple "semi-separated" in September 2021.</p>

<p>In January 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: "I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid." Despite experiencing periods of separation and fluctuating relationship statuses, Grimes described Musk as her "best friend and the love of my life" as of March 2022. In September 2023, it was reported the couple had another son. On September 29, Grimes sued Elon Musk over parental rights in a California court.</p>
