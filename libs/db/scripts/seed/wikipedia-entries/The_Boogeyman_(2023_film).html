<p>One day, a disturbed man called Lester Billings visits Will's office. Lester explains that his three children have died, all killed by an evil entity that latched onto his family. A disbelieving Will goes to call the police. Lester slips away and Sadie finds his body hanging in her mother's art closet.</p>

<h2>Release</h2>
<h3>Theatrical</h3>
<p><i>The Boogeyman</i> was released in the United States on June 2, 2023, by 20th Century Studios. It was originally planned to be released on Hulu in 2023, but following a positive test screening in December 2022, it was announced that it would instead be released theatrically. According to Savage, "When the movie tested so well, we decided it was time to get [Stephen King's] input, so we rented out his favorite cinema in Maine." He also stated, "He knows what he doesn't like and if we'd have fucked up his story, he'd have told us. But he sent a lovely almost-essay about how much he enjoyed the movie. And then the next day I wake up and there's an email in my inbox from Stephen King and he said he's still thinking about the movie. He said a few more nice things and the nicest thing that he said was, 'They'd be fucking stupid to release this on streaming and not in cinemas.'" An advanced screening of the film took place at CinemaCon on April 26, 2023, as part of the Walt Disney Studios' presentation of their 2023 release schedule.</p>

Savage's approach is efficient but workmanlike: he makes liberal use of jump scares and thunderous crashes on the score." She gave the film 3/5 stars. Frank Scheck of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> said the film "mostly works, thanks to the expertly calibrated atmospherics, a memorable visual style... and the committed performances of a very talented cast."

<p>Kevin Maher of <i>The Times</i> gave the film 2/5 stars, saying that it was "90 minutes of dark corridors, plot holes and jump scares, followed by a silly climactic confrontation and some saccharine nonsense in a therapist's office."
