<h1>Steve Harwell</h1>

<div>American musician and singer (1967–2023)</div>


<p><b>Steven Scott Harwell</b> (January 9, 1967 – September 4, 2023) was an American musician and singer. He served as the lead vocalist for the rock band Smash Mouth from its formation in 1994 until his retirement in 2021. Their songs include "Walkin' on the Sun" and "All Star".</p>



<h2>Career</h2>
<p>Harwell was initially a rapper in the group F.O.S. (Freedom of Speech). He abandoned the Public Enemy-influenced project upon hearing Dr. Dre's 1992 album <i>The Chronic</i> and realizing that the genre was changing.</p>

<p>Greg Camp formed Smash Mouth in 1994 with Harwell, Kevin Coleman, and Paul De Lisle. They first achieved success with their 1997 song "Walkin' on the Sun". The band's 1999 song "All Star" reached the top 10 in the United States, and regained popularity after being featured in the 2001 film <i>Shrek</i>.</p>

<p>Harwell was a featured cast member in the sixth season of the VH1 reality show <i>The Surreal Life</i> in 2006. He appeared on other television and radio shows, as well as making a cameo in the 2001 film <i>Rat Race</i>. He performed two songs, "Beside Myself" and "Everything Just Crazy", for the 2013 South Korean-Chinese animated film <i>Pororo, The Racing Adventure</i>.</p>

<p>During a Smash Mouth concert in Urbana, Illinois, on August 27, 2016, Harwell collapsed on stage and was taken by ambulance to a hospital. The band completed the show without him, De Lisle singing in his place. In August 2020, the band headlined at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota, with Harwell declaring "Now we're all here together tonight. And we're being human once again. Fuck that COVID shit"; the event was later classed as a superspreading event by the National Institutes of Health.</p>

<p>In October 2021, the band performed at a beer and wine festival at Bethel Woods Center for the Arts in Bethel, New York, where he appeared to be intoxicated, threatening audience members and performing what looked like a Nazi salute. He then announced his retirement due to ongoing health issues.</p>



<h2>Personal life, illness and death</h2>
<p>Harwell had a son named Presley, who died aged six months in July 2001 from acute lymphocytic leukemia and inspired the name of his father's disease prevention fund.</p>

<p>Throughout most of his life, Harwell struggled with alcoholism. In 2013, he was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and Wernicke encephalopathy, which can affect functions such as speech and memory. He was hospitalized in 2017 for his cardiomyopathy, leading to the cancellation of a show. He retired in 2021, due to these problems hindering his ability to perform.</p>

<p>Harwell died from liver failure at his home in Boise, Idaho, on September 4, 2023, one day after his manager, Robert Hayes, announced Harwell was in hospice for final-stage liver failure. He was 56 years old. In tribute, Hayes wrote: "Steve lived a 100% full-throttle life. Burning brightly across the universe before burning out."</p>
