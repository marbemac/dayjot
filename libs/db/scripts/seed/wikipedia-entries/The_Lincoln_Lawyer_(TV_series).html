Los Angeles lawyer Jerry Vincent is shot dead in a parking garage, and the killer steals his briefcase. His law practice is transferred to attorney Mickey Haller, supervised by Judge Mary Holder, including the case of Trevor Elliott, a video game designer accused of murdering his wife Lara and her lover. Taking over Jerry's office, Mickey and his paralegal/second ex-wife Lorna Crane refuse to let police detective Raymond Griggs search Jerry's files. Mickey meets Trevor, who is determined to go to trial in one week, and takes the case of Izzy Letts, a former drug addict accused of stealing a necklace. A recovering addict himself, Mickey gets Izzy's charges dropped and hires her as his driver. His first ex-wife, prosecutor Maggie McPherson, is wary as they work toward joint custody of their teenage daughter, Hayley. Mickey hires Lorna's boyfriend, Cisco, as his investigator and they visit Trevor's home, the scene of the murders, where Cisco reveals that he and Lorna are engaged. Mickey convinces Trevor to hire him as his attorney, and he and Izzy discover they are being followed.</td></tr>

Izzy and Mickey evade the SUV tailing them, which Mickey later sees outside his home. Cisco questions Jerry's investigator, Bruce Carlin, who tells him Jerry took him off Trevor's case. Judge Holder allows Mickey to give Griggs the names of clients who threatened Jerry, and in exchange, Griggs reveals that Jerry frequented a casino. Cisco and Lorna learn that yoga teacher Jan Rilz, Lara's murdered lover, had affairs with multiple clients. Mickey takes over the case of Terrell Coleman, a single father targeted by a jealous police officer, and brings Hayley to work with him, slowly repairing his relationship with Maggie. Lorna discovers that Jerry drafted a motion for a continuance but was killed before he could file it. Trevor is unwilling to jeopardize his company's pending acquisition, forcing Mickey to refuse a continuance from Judge Stanton. Jerry's receptionist, with whom he was having an affair, reveals that he had a "magic bullet" to win Trevor's case. Unbeknownst to Mickey, his car has been bugged by the driver of the mysterious SUV.</td></tr>

Mickey learns he is supposed to represent Eli Wyms, who is not among Jerry's files. Preparing to indict businessman Angelo Soto for trafficking undocumented workers, Maggie is assisted by Lee Lankford, a detective Mickey does not trust. Griggs shows Mickey a surveillance photo of a possible suspect in Jerry's murder, and Cisco discovers Carlin has gone into hiding, and gives Mickey a gun to protect himself. Mickey has the unresponsive Wyms, a veteran sniper arrested for shooting at police, taken off the medication he was given in custody. Lorna questions Carol Dubois, one of Rilz's "clients" who gave him a large investment, and she mentions another client, Neema Shavar. At Jerry's memorial, Lankford taunts Mickey for failing his client Jésus Menendez; tempted to drink, Mickey is saved by Izzy. Soto is arrested, while Trevor reveals to Mickey that he knew about his wife's affair, but maintains his innocence. Mickey realizes that Wyms was arrested hours before Trevor and is somehow Jerry's "magic bullet". In the parking garage, he encounters the man from Griggs' photo, who chases him to the office. Scaring him off with Cisco's gun, Mickey calls Griggs.</td></tr>

Mickey deduces that Griggs faked the surveillance photo and "suspect" to test whether Mickey was involved in Jerry's murder, and they plan to draw out the real killer, with Mickey announcing that he has backups of Jerry's stolen files. Soto makes bail, and Maggie's lead witness becomes unwilling to cooperate. Mickey meets Wyms, now coherent, who refuses to tell his story until Mickey gets him released. Seeing Mickey's announcement, Carlin warns him that Jerry's murder is connected to Trevor's case and agrees to meet. Mickey tells Izzy that Jésus Menendez was convicted of killing a prostitute after a witness disappeared. Spooked, Carlin calls off the meeting, and Mickey and Cisco find the bug in Mickey's car, which they leave to avoid tipping off whoever is listening. At Hayley's soccer game, Mickey negotiates a deal for Wyms, but Wyms knows nothing about Trevor's case. Cisco and Lorna track down Carlin, who is pulled over by police and accidentally struck and killed by a passing car. Mickey comforts Maggie after her witness is murdered; they share an intimate moment, and Mickey attends an NA meeting with Izzy.</td></tr>

Despite Trevor's refusal to hire a jury consultant, Mickey enlists Gwen, an expert poker player. Maggie's superior Janellle Simmons is running to unseat district attorney Robert Cardone, and tells her to prove Soto killed her witness or drop the charges. Mickey asks his client Cherry for help finding fellow prostitute Gloria "Glory Days" Dayton, the witness who disappeared after promising to testify for Menendez. Cisco learns that Neema Shavar's ex-husband Anton is the head of a shady security company, and Rilz filed a restraining order against him but failed to appear at the hearing. Despite Lorna's suspicion of Carol Dubois, Cisco approaches Neema and records himself being threatened by Anton. During voir dire, Trevor's actions force Mickey to excuse a favorable juror. Izzy learns her ex-girlfriend is using drugs again, and Mickey is accosted by the Road Saints, Cisco's former biker gang. Lorna encounters a former classmate from law school, which she left behind. Maggie and Lankford approach Tanya Cruz, Soto's pregnant girlfriend, and Maggie refers her to Mickey. Griggs tells Mickey that Jerry withdrew $150,000 the same day Carlin made a delivery, possibly a bribe for Trevor's case.</td></tr>

Mickey remembers his late father, a famed L.A. attorney himself, and consults his friend and colleague David "Legal" Siegel. Cisco finds out Mickey is assisting the Road Saints, and he and Lorna confirm that Judge Stanton was not the recipient of Jerry's bribe. Lara's former coworker Sonia Patel tells Mickey that Lara reached out for the first time in years, planning to meet before she was killed. Visiting an embittered Menendez in prison, Mickey admits to Izzy that his failure to help Menendez led to his addiction. Tanya asks for Mickey's help to escape Soto, while Cardone suggests Maggie support him for DA. A comment from Hayley leads Mickey to realize that Jerry's bribe was to buy a juror. He confronts Trevor, who admits that Juror Number Seven is a plant, and that his company is funded by Russian mobsters; he insists that he had nothing to do with the deaths of Lara, Rilz, or Jerry, but Lara was going to divorce him, putting the Russians' money at risk. Mickey remembers his father's words: it is harder to live with losing a case when you know your client is innocent.</td></tr>

Mickey asks Cisco to investigate Juror Number Seven and the dangerous Russian billionaire apparently funding Trevor's company. Lorna is confronted by Carol, who is convinced of Trevor's guilt. Cooperating with Maggie, Tanya reveals that Soto visits a flower shop just before people disappear or are killed, including Maggie's witness. Lorna breaks up a fight between Hayley and a soccer teammate, learning Hayley is being bullied for her father defending Trevor. In court, Mickey suggests that Rilz was the killer's primary target and Anton Shavar is a possible suspect. Lorna decides to return to law school, and Cisco identifies Juror Number Seven as Glenn McSweeney. Maggie and Lankford connect the flower shop to gang activity, with detectives Winters and Perez identifying a potential hitman. Judge Stanton receives an anonymous letter incriminating Juror Number Seven, who has disappeared, seemingly tipped off. Both Mickey and prosecutor Jeff Golantz refuse a mistrial, and Judge Stanton adjourns court to verify the rest of the jury. Mickey calls in a favor with the Road Saints to watch over Maggie and Hayley.</td></tr>

Cherry points Mickey to one of Gloria's regular clients, whom Cisco blackmails into arranging for Gloria to return to Los Angeles. Golantz calls Sonia as a surprise witness, and she describes Lara as a brilliant coder who was kept isolated by the controlling Trevor, but Mickey casts doubt on her motives for coming forward. Simmons pressures Maggie to convict Soto by the end of the week, and Lankford makes a questionable search of the suspected hitman's phone, but finds no definitive evidence. Izzy has reconnected with her drug-abusing ex-girlfriend, and Cisco becomes concerned about Mickey's dealings with the Road Saints. In court, a forensic technician confirms the large amount of gunshot residue found on Trevor's hands, but Mickey realizes that the casino Jerry seemed to frequent is near the vehicle maintenance facility for the county sheriff's department. With testimony from an amateur crime scene videographer, a sheriff's department mechanic, and a ballistics expert, Mickey establishes the "magic bullet": the gunshot residue came from Eli Wyms, transported in the same police vehicle hours before Trevor. Mickey also casts suspicion on Anton Shavar, but Trevor tells Mickey he still wants to testify himself. With Terrell Coleman's help, Mickey rescues Izzy after her ex-girlfriend nearly persuades her to get high.</td></tr>

Lankford fails to intimidate Soto's hitman into confessing, forcing Maggie to ask Tanya to wear a wire. Mickey reluctantly allows Trevor to take the stand, but faces a crushing cross-examination from Golantz. However, Mickey delivers a compelling closing argument, hinging on the impossibility of Trevor disposing of all evidence in the seven minutes before the police arrived. Cisco discovers that Trevor's Russian mob ties are a lie, leaving them unsure who has been spying on Mickey, but the jury finds Trevor not guilty, upsetting Carol. Mickey apologizes to Wyms for Jerry leaving him in prison, and gives him an affidavit allowing him to sue Jerry's estate for malpractice. With Maggie and Lankford monitoring nearby, Tanya records Soto implicating himself, and he nearly kills her before he is arrested. As Trevor celebrates his acquittal, Mickey confronts him with the truth: Lara was going to reveal herself as the true genius behind Trevor's success, so he killed her and Rilz, disposing of the gun and his bloody clothes with his drone. Trevor taunts Mickey, but claims not to know who has been spying on him. Lured to Griffith Park, Mickey is knocked out by Glenn McSweeney, Juror Number Seven.</td></tr>
<tr><th>10</th><td>10</td><td>"The Brass Verdict"</td><td>David Grossman</td><td>Ted Humphrey and Michael Connelly</td><td>May13,2022(2022-05-13)</td></tr><tr><td>
Mickey fights off McSweeney, who falls to his death, and rekindles his relationship with Maggie. Lorna finds Gloria and reveals that she dropped out of law school after a professor hit on her, and Gloria explains that Detective Perez threatened her into leaving town. Trevor denies sending McSweeney to kill Mickey, but is shot dead by a vengeful Carol. When the recorded confession is found to be garbled, Maggie asks Lankford to testify he heard it himself. At Menendez's hearing, Gloria testifies to being attacked by the real killer, a man with a distinctive tattoo. Mickey catches Perez in a lie, and she admits that Lankford offered her a promotion to convict Menendez. This destroys Maggie's case, making her angry with Mickey, and Cardone reassigns her to Van Nuys. Cisco offers to settle his debt to the Road Saints himself, and Maggie has Soto arrested on federal charges instead. Mickey deduces that Jerry bribed Judge Holder to tamper with Trevor's jury; she had Jerry killed by McSweeney and sent him to kill Mickey, having bugged his car. Holder is arrested, and Mickey greets Menendez on his release from prison, while Lorna reapplies to law school. Mickey goes surfing for the first time since the accident that led to his addiction, watched from afar by the man with the tattoo.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Mickey is attacked by two men in a parking garage. Months earlier, he is enjoying newfound fame after Trevor Elliot's acquittal, but his relationship with Maggie remains tense, and Izzy is back with her ex-girlfriend, Rae. Mickey is hired by Russell Lawson, arrested for breaking into a neighbor's home. The DA reopens the case against Jésus Menendez, with Griggs leading the investigation. Frustrated with her stalled career, Maggie leaves dinner with Mickey, and he meets chef Lisa Trammell, spending the night together. Lisa asks for his help with a restraining order from real estate developer Mitchell Bondurant for protesting his gentrification of her neighborhood. In the Menendez case, Griggs reveals that Jésus disposed of a knife similar to the murder weapon. Mickey successfully argues that Lawson drunkenly entered the wrong house after being roofied. Juggling law school and work, Lorna learns that Professor Wheaton, the instructor who hit on her, is the school's interim dean, and Cisco picks up a Road Saints member, Kaz, from prison, returning him to the gang. Lawson surprises Mickey at home, having staged his arrest to secure Mickey as his attorney, and reveals himself as the real killer in the Menendez case.</td></tr>

Trapped by Lawson's attorney-client privilege, Mickey is advised by Legal Siegel to stop representing Menendez. Lawson continues to taunt Mickey, who tries to help Gloria avoid charges for cocaine possession. Izzy wants to open her own dance studio with Rae, and Cisco learns that Gloria's cocaine-dealing client is a high-ranking member of the Tijuana cartel. Mickey offers the client to Maggie to bolster her career, in exchange for dropping the charges against Gloria. Lisa faces increasing pressure from Bondurant, and Lorna confronts Wheaton. The Road Saints' leader, Teddy Vogel, is suspicious of Kaz's early parole, forcing Cisco to investigate whether Kaz is an informant. Mickey tells Griggs he is no longer representing Menendez, but has Gloria provide Griggs with a description of her attacker, Lawson. She is released and returns home, where she is attacked by Lawson but saved by Griggs, who realizes Mickey used Gloria as bait to maintain confidentiality. Gloria tells Mickey she is leaving for Hawaii, and he visits a furious Lawson in jail before informing Menendez his case has finally been dismissed. He gets a call from Lisa, who has been arrested for Bondurant's murder.</td></tr>

Lisa maintains her innocence from jail, but video of her interrogation leaves Mickey concerned. At Lisa's arraignment, Mickey is taunted by prosecutor Andrea Freemann, Maggie's friend, and he provides Lisa with a contract to her life rights to cover her $2 million bail. Lorna confides her worries about Cisco to Izzy, and Lisa is bailed out by Henry Dahl, a true crime podcaster, but Mickey refuses to allow him to produce a series about Lisa. Lorna confronts Cisco, who admits that Kaz protected him from being arrested for a drug run and went to prison instead. Lorna reveals why she initially left law school, causing Cisco to threaten Wheaton. When Hayley overhears Maggie and Freemann discuss Lisa's trial, Mickey threatens to have Freemann removed from the case, forcing her to turn over discovery immediately. He is accosted by Maggie for using Hayley, and she realizes he slept with Lisa. Mickey warns Lisa that their relationship must remain professional, though she pressures him into admitting that he believes she is innocent. As Lisa leaves, Henry watches from afar.</td></tr>

Freemann buries Mickey's office in files, and Lorna considers that Lisa may be guilty, suggesting the murder weapon was a hammer missing from Lisa's tool kit. Lisa opens up to Mickey about her ex-husband Jeff, and Mickey's former client Terrell Coleman asks him to help his teenage daughter Angelica, charged with vandalism. Freemann offers a plea deal, which Mickey believes proves there is a flaw in her case, while Cisco questions Walter Kim, a building inspector with a photo of Lisa assaulting Bondurant at a protest, which led to the restraining order. Mickey learns Henry has started the podcast anyway, and Lisa rejects Freemann's deal, while Mickey's team learns that Bondurant lost $200 million on a construction project.

<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>In 2018, David E. Kelley wrote a spec script for a television series set up at Epix by A+E Studios. When the script failed to move forward, he decided to work on a different project with A+E, ultimately adapting <i>The Lincoln Lawyer</i> after sharing his interests in working on legal dramas. In June 2019, the project was given a series production commitment by CBS. In February 2020, Ted Humphrey came aboard as showrunner and Kiele Sanchez joined the cast as Lorna, with Angus Sampson and Jazz Raycole joining a few weeks later as Cisco and Izzy, respectively. In May 2020, it was reported that the series would not be going forward at CBS due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.</p>

<p>At the time of the decision, which CBS Entertainment President Kelly Kahl called a "tough call", two scripts for the series had been written, with two more in development, and Logan Marshall-Green had been in negotiations to star as main character Mickey Haller. On January 11, 2021, Netflix picked up the series with a 10-episode order, down from the original 13-episode plan, and announced that Manuel Garcia-Rulfo would star as Haller. In February 2021, Neve Campbell and Becki Newton joined the cast, with Raycole and Sampson returning to the series. Christopher Gorham was cast in March. In April, Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine was cast in a role created specifically for the series, with LisaGay Hamilton, Jamie McShane, and Reggie Lee joining the cast in recurring roles. Krista Warner was cast in May.</p>

<p>On June 14, 2022, Netflix renewed the series for a second season, which will be based on <i>The Fifth Witness</i>. On August 30, 2023, Netflix renewed the series for a third season, which will be based on <i>The Gods of Guilt</i>.</p>

<h3>Filming</h3>
<p><i>The Lincoln Lawyer</i> began filming in Los Angeles on March 30, 2021. That same day, author Michael Connelly revealed on social media that the COVID-19 pandemic had previously delayed principal photography for around a year. On June 8, 2021, Connelly said in an interview that six out of the ten episodes had been filmed, of which three of them had been edited completely, while also confirming that characters in the Amazon Prime Video series <i>Bosch</i>, including Haller's half-brother Harry Bosch (portrayed by Titus Welliver), would not be making appearances as both shows are from different networks. Filming concluded on August 3, 2021. Notable filming locations included Admiralty Way in Marina del Rey, Spring Street in Downtown Los Angeles, Grand Avenue, the Wilshire Ebell Theatre, and Wilshire Boulevard.</p>

<p>Filming on season 2 was due to begin on October 31, 2022 and run through March 2023. Filming locations for season 2 included the Paseo Club in Valencia, The Cowboy Palace Saloon in Chatsworth, Sixth Street Bridge, and the Los Angeles Equestrian Center.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit</h3>
<p>In August 2021, A+E Studios subsidiary Frankl &amp; Bob Films II, LLC filed a lawsuit against ViacomCBS for "millions of dollars" in losses after it decided to not move forward with the series the previous year. Citing the company's creation on December 4, 2019, the documents state that "after the merger, ViacomCBS's new leadership, led by [George Cheeks] had second-guessed CBS Network's decision to enter into the 13-episode series commitment," and that after finding it "was not valuable to ViacomCBS ... Mr. Cheeks and his fellow ViacomCBS executives decided that it would be better for ViacomCBS as a whole if CBS Network breached that commitment." The documents also claim that ViacomCBS rejected the series because the first episode had not been filmed and said "that breach ensured that the series would never make it onto broadcast television."</p>
