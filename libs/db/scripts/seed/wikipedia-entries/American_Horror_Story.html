<p><i><b>American Horror Story</b></i> is an American horror anthology television series created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk for the cable network FX. The first installment in the <i>American Story</i> media franchise, seasons of <i>AHS</i> are mostly conceived as self-contained miniseries, following a different set of characters in a new setting within the same fictional universe (which the show occasionally utilizes for crossovers between seasons, and shares with episodic spin-off <i>American Horror Stories</i>), and a storyline with its own "beginning, middle, and end." Some plot elements of each season are loosely inspired by true events. Many actors appear in more than one season, usually playing a new character though sometimes as a returning character, and often playing multiple characters in a season. Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, and Lily Rabe have returned most frequently, with each having appeared in nine seasons, followed by Frances Conroy and Denis O'Hare who both appear in eight; Emma Roberts, Billie Lourd, and Leslie Grossman appear in six, while other notable actors including Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett, Adina Porter, Finn Wittrock, and Jamie Brewer appear in five of the seasons.</p>

<p>The first season, <i>Murder House</i>, takes place in Los Angeles, California, in 2011, and centers on a family in a haunted house. The second season, <i>Asylum</i>, takes place in Massachusetts in 1964 and follows the patients and staff of a criminally insane institution. The third season, <i>Coven</i>, takes place in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2013, and follows a coven of witches and their enemies. The fourth season, <i>Freak Show</i>, takes place in Jupiter, Florida, in 1952 and centers on an American freak show. The fifth season, <i>Hotel</i>, takes place in Los Angeles, California, during 2015 and focuses on the staff and guests of a supernatural hotel. The sixth season, <i>Roanoke</i>, takes place in North Carolina during 2014–2016 and focuses on an isolated farmhouse haunted by the deceased Roanoke colony.  The seventh season, <i>Cult</i>, takes place in Michigan, and centers on a cult after the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The eighth season, <i>Apocalypse</i>, features the <i>Coven</i> witches and the <i>Murder House</i> Antichrist. The ninth season, <i>1984</i>, takes place outside Los Angeles in the 1980s and focuses on the staff of a summer camp reopening after a massacre. The tenth season, <i>Double Feature</i>, focuses on a family in 2021 in Provincetown, Massachusetts and the town's true inhabitants, and a group of camping students in a conspiracy involving the extraterrestrials of <i>Asylum</i>. The eleventh season, <i>NYC</i>, takes place in 1980s New York City, and focuses on the killings of gay men and the emergence of a virus. The twelfth season, <i>Delicate</i>, takes place in New York City and follows an actress who comes to believe that someone is going to great lengths to stop her from fulfilling her dream of getting pregnant. In January 2020, FX renewed the series through to season 13.</p><p>

Although reception to individual seasons has varied, <i>American Horror Story</i> has largely been well received by television critics, with the majority of the praise going towards the cast, particularly Jessica Lange, who won two Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performances. James Cromwell and Kathy Bates each won an Emmy Award for their performances, while Lady Gaga won a Golden Globe Award. The series draws consistently high ratings for the FX network, with its first season being the most-viewed new cable series of 2011. </p>

<h3><i>Murder House</i> (2011)</h3>
<div>Main article: <i>American Horror Story: Murder House</i></div>
 
<p>Set in 2011, the season follows the Harmons, consisting of wife and mother Vivien (Connie Britton), her psychiatrist husband Ben (Dylan McDermott), and their teenage daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga), as they move from Boston to Los Angeles to make a fresh start after Vivien has a miscarriage. Soon after the miscarriage and before the move, Ben has an affair with one of his students, which almost tears the family apart. They move into a restored mansion and soon encounter the residence's housekeeper, Moira O'Hara (Frances Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge), as well as their neighbors—the eccentric Langdon family, consisting of Constance (Jessica Lange) and her daughter Adelaide (Jamie Brewer), who has Down Syndrome. The Harmons' lives are troubled by the meddling Langdons, the incompetent realtor Marcy (Christine Estabrook), as well as the disfigured Larry Harvey (Denis O'Hare), a former resident of the mansion who is secretly in love with Constance, and the scorned Hayden McClaine (Kate Mara), Ben's former student who follows him to Los Angeles. Ben and Vivien try to rekindle their relationship while Violet, experiencing depression, finds comfort in Tate (Evan Peters), one of Ben's patients. The family soon discovers that the home is haunted by the ghosts of anyone who has ever died on the property, including its creators Charles (Matt Ross) and Nora Montgomery (Lily Rabe); and their deformed son Thaddeus (Ben Woolf) who is sometimes referred to as the 'Infantata'. Flashbacks depict the mansion's previous homeowners throughout the last century, dating back to its construction in the 1920s.</p>


<h3><i>Asylum</i> (2012–2013)</h3>
<div>Main article: <i>American Horror Story: Asylum</i></div>
<p>Set in 1964, the season follows the patients and staff members of the church-owned mental asylum Briarcliff Manor, located in an undisclosed town in Massachusetts, which was founded to treat and house the criminally insane. Kit Walker (Evan Peters), accused of being a prolific serial killer named "Bloody Face" after the disappearance of his wife Alma (Britne Oldford)—though he claims she was abducted by aliens—is incarcerated at Briarcliff. This piques the interest of ambitious lesbian journalist Lana Winters (Sarah Paulson), who is yearning to find a story for her big break. At Briarcliff, Kit meets the other patients, many of whom claim to be unjustly institutionalized, including microcephalic Pepper (Naomi Grossman), nymphomaniac Shelley (Chloe Sevigny), whose cheating husband hypocritically committed her after finding her in bed with two guys; and the unassuming Grace Bertrand (Lizzie Brocheré) from France. Believed to be a violent serial killer, Kit becomes the subject of interest of pragmatic psychiatrist Oliver Thredson (Zachary Quinto) and the sadistic Dr. Arthur Arden (James Cromwell), the latter of whom routinely conducts scientific operations on patients. The institution is run under the watchful eye of the stern Sister Jude (Jessica Lange), as well as her second-in-command, the naïve Sister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe), and the founder of the institution, Monsignor Timothy Howard (Joseph Fiennes). Briarcliff's inhabitants are routinely subject to supernatural and scientific influences, including demonic possession and extraterrestrial abduction.</p>

<div>Main article: <i>American Horror Story: Coven</i></div>
<p>Set in 2013, the season follows the dwindling descendants of the witches who survived the Salem witch trials and their struggle to hide their identity in the modern world. Those who share this genetic condition are being subjected to violent attacks from outside forces, such as voodoo practitioners. Zoe Benson (Taissa Farmiga), a young teenager completely unaware of the existence of witches, discovers her identity as a Salem descendant after an accident that causes the death of her boyfriend. She is sent to an all-girls boarding school in New Orleans which aims to protect and house young women who carry this unique bloodline, and keep them from the dangers of the outside world. There, she meets the other students, narcissistic movie star Madison Montgomery (Emma Roberts), outspoken human voodoo doll Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe), and enigmatic mind-reading Nan (Jamie Brewer), and gets romantically entangled with Kyle Spencer (Evan Peters), a non-witch and good-natured college student. The school is run by headmistress Cordelia Foxx (Sarah Paulson), head of the Witches Council, eccentric fashionista Myrtle Snow (Frances Conroy), and the mute butler Spalding (Denis O'Hare). Cordelia's mother, Fiona Goode (Jessica Lange), is the Supreme and most powerful witch of her generation, though she regularly avoids her responsibilities, much to the chagrin of Cordelia and her long-time rival Myrtle. After a mob of townspeople discover and burn a young witch living in the swamps named Misty Day (Lily Rabe), Fiona returns to lead the coven, creating conflict with Cordelia and the other young witches as they all conspire to become the next supreme.</p>

<h3><i>Freak Show</i> (2014–2015)</h3>
<div>Main article: <i>American Horror Story: Freak Show</i></div>
<p>Set in 1952, the season follows a struggling freak show led by Elsa Mars (Jessica Lange) in the sleepy town of Jupiter, Florida. Decades have passed since the public has looked upon freak shows as a form of entertainment, but Elsa dreams of finding a home for her "monsters", as well as for her own fame and fortune. Other members of her troupe include "Lobster Boy" Jimmy Darling (Evan Peters), who dreams of living a normal life, and his mother Ethel (Kathy Bates), a bearded lady who acts as Elsa's second-in-command by maintaining law and order under the tent. A strongman from Ethel's past and Jimmy's biological father Dell Toledo (Michael Chiklis), and his three-breasted wife Desiree Dupree (Angela Bassett), arrive to join the freak show. To drum up business and save her troupe once and for all, Elsa also recruits conjoined twin sisters Bette and Dot Tattler (Sarah Paulson) to perform for her show. In a time when the era of television is beginning to reign high over sideshow acts, these individuals must overcome those who persecute them based on their looks. However, as the season unfolds, it is revealed that multiple dark entities have taken up residence in Jupiter, with all of their eyes being set on the freaks. A conman named Stanley (Denis O'Hare), posing as a Hollywood executive, arrives with his young protégé Maggie Esmerelda (Emma Roberts), who becomes involved with Jimmy. The wealthy and spoiled Dandy Mott (Finn Wittrock), enabled by his doting mother Gloria (Frances Conroy), develops an unhealthy obsession with the freaks, particularly Bette and Dot. Perhaps the most dangerous of them all is a mysterious, deformed killer clown, known only as Twisty (John Carroll Lynch), who wreaks havoc on Jupiter and appears to be targeting freaks and townspeople alike.</p>


<h3><i>Hotel</i> (2015–2016)</h3>
<div>Main article: <i>American Horror Story: Hotel</i></div>
<p>Set in 2015, the season follows the strange and dangerous happenings that seem to center around the retro Hotel Cortez in downtown Los Angeles, California, initially built as a secret torture chamber to fulfill the violent desires of founder James Patrick March (Evan Peters). Detective John Lowe (Wes Bentley) arrives at the hotel, based on intel from an anonymous tip, to investigate a grisly string of murders, each of which exemplifies a sin in violation of one of the Ten Commandments. He has become estranged from his wife Alex (Chloe Sevigny), who has  depression, and his daughter Scarlett (Shree Crooks), after the disappearance of their son Holden (Lennon Henry) five years earlier. The hotel is led by March's fashionista widow Elizabeth Johnson (Lady Gaga), also known as the Countess—who was mutated into a vampire by her former lovers, actor Rudolph Valentino (Finn Wittrock) and his wife Natacha Rambova (Alexandra Daddario)—and her current lover Donovan (Matt Bomer). Throughout his investigation, John also becomes entangled with the spirits of a heroin junkie named Sally McKenna (Sarah Paulson), hotel maid Hazel Evers (Mare Winningham), and James Patrick March, who is looking for a protégé to continue the violent acts he started when he was alive. The hotel's tireless staff includes the surly front desk manager Iris (Kathy Bates), Donovan's mother, and her best friend, the transgender bartender Liz Taylor (Denis O'Hare), both of whom hesitantly cater to Elizabeth and her vampiric children, one out of a desire to remain close to her son and the other out of a sense of loyalty. Elizabeth's relationship with Donovan becomes troubled with the arrival of attractive male model and cocaine addict Tristan Duffy (also played by Wittrock), New York fashion designer Will Drake (Cheyenne Jackson), and her scorned ex-lover Ramona Royale (Angela Bassett), all of whom become entangled in her violent life.</p>


<h3><i>Roanoke</i> (2016)</h3>
<div>Main article: <i>American Horror Story: Roanoke</i></div>
<p>Set from 2014 to 2016, the season follows the supernatural events that occur in a renovated farmhouse in North Carolina, which is situated on the land where the Roanoke Colony moved after their infamous 1580s disappearance. In 2015, Shelby Miller (Lily Rabe), her husband Matt (André Holland), along with Matt's sister Lee Harris (Adina Porter) recounted their harrowing experience living in the farmhouse a year prior in a popular documentary series titled <i>My Roanoke Nightmare</i>, including their encounters with the violent and vengeful ghosts of the house's previous residents and the Roanoke Colony, the cannibalistic Polk family who live nearby, and the seductive English witch, Scathach (Lady Gaga). The documentary becomes a huge success, featuring dramatic reenactments of the Millers' story starring Audrey Tindall (Sarah Paulson) as Shelby, Dominic Banks (Cuba Gooding Jr.) as Matt, Monet Tumusiime (Angela Bassett) as Lee, Agnes Mary Winstead (Kathy Bates) as Thomasin White—also known as The Butcher, leader of the ghost colony, Audrey's husband Rory Monahan (Evan Peters) as Edward Philipe Mott, the creator and first owner of the house, William van Henderson (Denis O'Hare) as Dr. Elias Cunningham, a professor who becomes entranced with the paranormal happenings of the area, and Dylan (Wes Bentley) as Ambrose White, Thomasin's son, and accomplice. In 2016, the success of the documentary leads to a sequel titled <i>Return to Roanoke: Three Days in Hell</i>, spearheaded by the producer of the original series, Sidney Aaron James (Cheyenne Jackson), who invites the Millers, as well as many of the reenactment actors, to return to the farmhouse for three days during the blood moon, where all their actions will be captured by hidden cameras. Although the Millers are aware of the entities that reside in the house, all three agree to return, each with their own agenda.

As Ally attempts to re-adjust to regular life despite her growing anxiety and paranoia, she becomes terrorized by a group of masked assailants, donned in clown attire, who are only present when she is alone, leaving those around her to wonder if she was truly attacked, or if they were merely hallucinations.

On May 10, 2023, it was announced that the production of the season was halted due to the strike. On August 15, FX set the premiere date for September 20, 2023.</p>

<h3>Future seasons</h3>
<p>On December 5, 2018, Murphy said the witches from <i>Coven</i> will return in a future season. On January 9, 2020, the series was renewed through season 13.</p>



<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Conception</h3>
<div>

<blockquote>
<p>What you saw in the finale was the end of the Harmon house. The second season of the show will be a brand-new home or building to haunt. Just like this year, every season of this show will have a beginning, middle and end. [The second season] won't be in L.A. It will obviously be in America, but in a completely different locale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– Murphy on the series' anthology format</p>
</div>

<p>Creators Murphy and Falchuk began working on <i>American Horror Story</i> before their Fox series <i>Glee</i> began production. Murphy wanted to do the opposite of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated: "I went from <i>Nip/Tuck</i> to <i>Glee</i>, so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me." Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. "You want people to be a little bit off balance afterwards," he said.</p>

<p>In February 2011, FX officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series from Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, with both Murphy and Falchuk writing and Murphy directing. Dante Di Loreto was announced as executive producer. Production on the series began in April 2011. In July 2011, FX officially announced the project had been picked up to become a full series.</p>

<p>From the beginning, Murphy and Falchuk planned that each season of the series would tell a different story. After the first-season finale aired, Murphy spoke of his plans to change the cast and location for the second season. He did say, however, that some actors who starred in the first season would be returning. "The people that are coming back will be playing completely different characters, creatures, monsters, etc. [The Harmons'] stories are done. People who are coming back will be playing entirely new characters," he announced. In November 2012, FX chief executive, John Landgraf, described the unique format of the series stating: "[T]he notion of doing an anthological series of miniseries with a repertory cast—has proven groundbreaking, wildly successful and will prove to be trendsetting."</p>

<p>At the 2013 PaleyFest, Falchuk compared the series to horror films: "It does demand a little bit of compassion at the end because you fall in love with these characters in a different way than you would in a movie," he said. "If you want to kill everybody in a movie except one person, you can kind of get away with that, but if you're looking to do a horror TV show, you have a different responsibility to the characters because the audience has a different affection for them."</p>

<p>Murphy then explained the process of planning a series' season takes about a year. "We come up with story first and then we come up with the characters," he said. "It is a repertory company, so we'll move people around and sometimes there won't yet be a role for somebody. Like when we started [the second season], I really had no idea that Dylan [McDermott] would be the person to play Sarah's son, but the deeper we got, I thought, that would work great."</p>

<p>In an August 2015 article for <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, Murphy revealed that the show is producing two seasons a year, the first being broadcast late in the year and the second early in the next year. He explained, "We're doing something that we've never done before on the show where we're doing two different groups of writers rooms. Some of our writers will be bouncing around but a whole different group coming in late August. The next thing we're crafting up is very, very different than [<i>Hotel</i>]. Not smaller. But just not opulent. More rogue and more dark."</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<div>See also: List of <i>American Horror Story</i> cast members</div>


<p>Connie Britton was the first to be cast in the series, portraying female lead Vivien Harmon on <i>Murder House</i>. Denis O'Hare joined second as Larry Harvey. Jessica Lange soon followed as Constance, her first regular role on television. Dylan McDermott joined the cast soon after Lange as the male lead Ben Harmon. Taissa Farmiga and Evan Peters were the last actors to be added to the main cast, portraying Violet Harmon and Tate Langdon, respectively.</p>


<p>In March 2012, Murphy revealed that the second season had been planned around Jessica Lange, who portrays Sister Jude, a sadistic nun who runs the asylum. Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, Lily Rabe and Zachary Quinto also return to join the main cast. Peters portrays Kit Walker, an inmate accused of murdering his wife. Paulson portrays Lana Winters, a lesbian reporter who gets committed to the asylum because of her sexuality and intent to snoop around the sanitarium. Rabe's character is Sister Mary Eunice, clumsy second-in-charge to Sister Jude. Quinto portrays Dr. Thredson, a psychiatrist at the asylum. Lizzie Brocheré stars as Grace Bertrand, a character described originally as "a fierce, ferocious, extremely sexual, and dangerous wild-child sexpot", but the role was later heavily revamped. James Cromwell co-stars as Dr. Arthur Arden, who proclaims to be in charge of the asylum and performs dark experiments on its patients. Joseph Fiennes starred as Monsignor Timothy Howard, a possible love interest for Sister Jude.</p>


<p>For the third season, series executive producers and co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk stated that, as with the second season, "many actors" would return in different roles, beginning with Jessica Lange. Evan Peters and Sarah Paulson were confirmed to return, portraying Kyle Spencer and Cordelia Goode, respectively. Murphy added that Lange would portray a "real glamour-cat lady", later revealed to be named Fiona Goode. Taissa Farmiga, Violet in the first season, starred as Zoe Benson, a character that is involved in a prominent romance during the season. Lily Rabe co-starred as Misty Day. Recurring cast member Frances Conroy joined as a main cast member, playing the character of Myrtle Snow. Oscar-winning actress Kathy Bates was confirmed to co-star. It was first reported that she would portray "a woman who, at the start, is Lange's character's best friend, but will become her worst enemy", but this was altered.

<h3>Filming</h3>
<p>The pilot episode was shot on location in a house in Country Club Park, Los Angeles, California, which serves as the haunted house and crime scene in the series. Designed and built in 1908 by Alfred Rosenheim, the president of the American Institute of Architects' Los Angeles chapter, the Tudor or Collegiate Gothic-style single family home was previously used as a convent. The first season was filmed on sets which are an exact replica of the house. Details such as Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows and hammered bronze light fixtures were recreated to preserve the look of the house.</p>

<p>Production and shooting for the second season began in late July 2012 for a scheduled premiere in mid October. The exteriors for the second season were filmed in Hidden Valley, Ventura County, California, a rural area outside Los Angeles, although the season took place in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Principal photography for the third season began on July 23, 2013, in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was first reported that the season would be filmed in multiple locations, but filming primarily took place in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Principal photography for the fourth season began on July 15, 2014, in New Orleans, though the story takes place in Jupiter, Florida.</p>

<p>Principal photography for the fifth season began on July 14, 2015, in Los Angeles, California, where the story also takes place. Murphy revealed a six-story hotel set was being built on the Fox lot. A dummy set of the hotel was built at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con, showing an Art Deco-style building from the 1920s, inspired by the old Hollywood era.</p>

<p>Filming for the sixth season began on July 6, 2016, at Santa Clarita, California. Set constructions include a colonial settler home to speculate the disappearance of the Roanoke Colony.</p>

<p>Filming for the seventh season was originally planned to begin in Orange, California, in June 2017 before it was moved to May instead.</p>

<p>Filming for the eighth season began on June 16, 2018. It was filmed in multiple locations.</p>

<p>On July 11, 2019, Murphy confirmed that the ninth season had begun filming.</p>

<p>Season 10 was originally supposed to film in March 2020, but was delayed to the Fall due to COVID-19. On November 2, Sarah Paulson confirmed via Instagram livestream that filming is set to begin either November 9, 10, or 11. On December 2, Lily Rabe confirmed that filming had begun.

On the same day, it was reported that production resumed and that the cast and crew were using a back entrance to enter the studio and avoid crossing the picket line. On May 10, 2023, it was announced that the production of the season was halted due to the strike. Filming once again continued and is expected to wrap in late October.</p>

<h3>Title sequences</h3>
<p><i>American Horror Story</i>'s title screens offer vague hints to important plot elements and events that compose each season. For <i>Murder House</i>, Murphy described the sequence as a mini-mystery and stated that: "By the time you see the ninth episode of this season, every image in that title sequence will be explained," establishing the purpose of the title sequence for future seasons.</p>

<p>The opening title sequence was created by Kyle Cooper and his company Prologue. He also created the title sequence for the AMC series <i>The Walking Dead</i> and the 1995 film <i>Seven</i>. The theme music was composed by sound designer Cesar Davila-Irizarry and musician Charlie Clouser. The cinematography was done by Juan Ruiz Anchía and the editing by Gabriel J. Diaz.</p>

<p>For <i>Murder House</i>, the sequence is set in the Harmons' basement and includes images of postmortem young children, fetuses in jars, skulls, a christening dress, a nurse's uniform, and a figure holding a pair of bloody hedge clippers. A photo of alleged axe murderer Lizzie Borden is also shown. Texts in the sequence are white, superimposed on black background and have a film burning effect.</p>

<p><i>Asylum</i>'s opening sequence is done by the same creative team. "We are shooting a new title sequence with the same team that did last year's," series creator Ryan Murphy said. "The song may stay... not sure." The music was kept, and the new title sequence was set around the Asylum, using shots of inmates raving and surgeons operating on patients with bandages obscuring their faces. Elements include a young girl walking backwards on her hands and feet up a staircase and a shot of the Virgin Mary's smile changing from one of benevolence to one of spite. Texts in the sequence are yellow, superimposed on a black grainy background.</p>

<p><i>Coven</i>'s opening sequence keeps the same music, and this sequence is the first one to be filmed primarily outside and not in an enclosed location. Shots include figures wearing black robes and capirotes, a skeletal creature with wings and shots of dead goats, the Minotaur from the season also appears. For the first time, there are actual backgrounds that appear with the actor names instead of an all-black background, some of these images include witches hanging and Santa Muerte. Other elements include a black man with piercing eyes and a disturbing smile as well as voodoo dolls burning. The final shot continues after the figures in black capirotes seize one of their own who is later seen burning at a stake where young, dress-clad witches dance around.</p>

<p><i>Freak Show</i>'s opening sequence changed things up, the series' theme music remains intact albeit with an added carnival-like soundscape. The sequence is composed of both CGI and stop-motion animation and features strange characters such as a skeletal chimera of a human being and an elephant riding a bicycle, a skeleton of what appears to be a single head but two bodies, a devilish-looking man, a boy in a wheelchair with deformed legs, a character with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet, a clown who can twist his head around, a woman with a third leg where her genitalia should be, and a demonic cymbal-banging monkey toy. There are also shots of side show attractions like the Human Blockhead, knife throwing and sword swallowing. The main recurring element features a balloon twister popping balloons with a knife. All text appeared to be made from rusty metal.</p>

<p><i>Hotel</i>'s opening sequence also was very different from previous seasons, taking more of a biblical approach. The font, while remaining the same as the first four seasons, glows in red against a hotel wallpaper. The Ten Commandments are also shown throughout the sequence. The intro returns to live-action like the first three seasons. Visuals include many people scrubbing blood all over the walls and the floor, strange things shown through peepholes, people being victims to the hotel, little kids running around the hotel, a woman screaming as she smears lipstick all over her face, as well as many different creatures.</p>

<p><i>Roanoke</i> featured no title sequence or opening credits, instead opting for a simple title card from the first season, <i>Murder House</i>, while the series' theme music plays over the end credits. At the end of the finale's credits, the title of the season "<i>American Horror Story: Roanoke</i>" was revealed.</p>

<p>In the development of <i>Cult</i>, Murphy confirmed that the opening sequence would return. <i>Cult</i>'s opening sequence features the series' theme music played by a marching band. The sequence is live action. Visuals include: a gang of clowns rising from a casket, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton masks, a George Washington statue, a dead dog killed by toxic gas, a merry-go-round, bloody hands that cannot be washed, a beehive, toxic smoke released from a grenade, holes in several forms, a bloody US flag with the sound of a xylophone playing "The Star-Spangled Banner", a blood-covered couple having sex, a magician pulling guts out of a hat and a handcuffed pinky promise. All text appeared to be made from rusty metal. The texts interact with the graphic behind them, sometimes also bloody. For the first time, the title is abbreviated as <i>AHS</i> instead of <i>American Horror Story</i>.</p>

<p><i>Apocalypse</i>'s opening sequence features the original theme music from the first three seasons. The sequence includes images of nuclear disaster and sketches of demons fusing together. Other visuals include burning candles, snakes, both human and goat skulls, a scorpion, a blooming flower, and photos of nuclear-testing documents. Visuals from the title sequences of both season one and season three are also included with slight alterations, including the skeletal winged creature in the forest (<i>Coven</i>), the nurse's blouse (<i>Murder House</i>), a picture of a baby that has been set on fire (<i>Murder House</i>), and the goat skulls (<i>Coven</i>). All text appeared to be glowing in pale yellow and red.</p>

<p><i>1984</i>'s opening sequence is inspired by a fan-made concept that strongly impressed Ryan Murphy. Corey Vega, the creator of the fan-made title sequence, was invited to work with <i>American Horror Story</i> veteran title-sequence designer Kyle Cooper to create the official sequence. The sequence imitates old VHS video quality. For the first time, a new slasher-style font is used for the text with the exception of vowels "O" and "A" staying with the original series' logo font. Visuals include: five Jazzercise instructors warming up before blood stains the screen, peaceful camping activities, bloody sharp objects (knives, cleavers, and an axe), a hidden killer in black, moonwalking, footage of the 1984 United States presidential election, cassette tapes, a smashed blood-filled wine glass, vehicles gearing up, and a campfire exploding. It ends with a self-destructed cassette. Names of the cast are superimposed on colorful neon graphics. The title is abbreviated as <i>AHS</i> instead of <i>American Horror Story</i> for the second time, after <i>Cult</i>. And for the second time, the last name mentioned is not given an "and" credit, also after <i>Cult</i>.</p>

<p><i>Double Feature</i>'s opening sequence features the original theme music from past seasons and the same font. Part One: <i>Red Tide</i> the opening sequence first shows chemicals bubbling in a scientific beacon then cuts to a flame being drawn and a lighthouse. The sequence continues to show graphic images of a knife slicing meat and being drained with blood, dead animals/aquatic life, insects, and a typewriter types out "Fade in", "chapter 10", "cut to", and types letter by letter sped up "fade to black". It follows with drug paraphernalia being cooked with a flame on a spoon and bubbling over. Black pills are being spilled onto a white background, images of teeth and x-rays of human bodies are being flashed on x-ray prints and tilted. In Part Two: <i>Death Valley</i> the opening sequence is completely black and white shows images of intestines, and tentacles. There is a UFO which seems to light up and hover above the ground and spins. A man of unknown origin in a black business suit is being lifted up by said UFO with a bright white light, the tentacles are manipulating time, a shadow of a patient which is in a grainy background on a hospital table raises up slowly while the scene turns counterclockwise. The sequence follows bloody hospital knives being dropped on a black glass surface and tentacles wrapping themselves around humans and out of their mouths. The sequence ends with alien fetal development being fed through a fallopian tube with tentacles wrapping around the fetus and out of its eyes, ears and mouth.</p>

<p><i>NYC</i>'s opening sequence retains the show's original theme music, with added sound effects such as whips, cameras and chains. The opening shows various types of BDSM imagery; including cages, rope, whipping, ball-gags, leather masks etc. Throughout the titles we are shown cocktail umbrellas (referencing the season's "Mai Thai Killer") and photography equipment. There are also microscopic images of a virus multiplying and infecting people's bodies; deer spooked by car headlights; blood dripping from statues and into cocktails; emaciated corpses dancing together; bloody severed hands and feet hung by chains; different colored bandanas; and a necklace with the inscription <i>"Saint Christopher. Protect us. Protect me and lead me safely to my destiny."</i> Patti LuPone is given an "And" credit; something that has been absent from the main titles since <i>Apocalypse</i>.</p>

<p><i>Delicate</i>'s title sequence once again keeps the original version of the opening theme. With imagery largely saturated with red lighting, the sequence shows several shots of pregnant women's bodies; bloody gynaecological and surgical instruments; references to IVF; spiders crawling across bellies and faces; snakes writhing; a red eyed stork holding a crying baby; flowers blooming; fetal skeletons (one of which lies in a gift box engraved with an occult symbol); dolls and strollers on fire; cosmetics such as: lipstick, nail polish, lip filler and eyelash curlers; a woman having her eye lid surgically removed; spiky high heeled shoes; pearls; a goat (both alive and as a rotting corpse);  a baby with long black nails being breastfed; a placenta dropped on a silver platter and women in long veils. The text for the credits is a thinner version of the usual font and appears to be made from shiny silver.</p>

<p>The title sequence for season 1 to 8 as well as season 10 to 12 of the show use a variation of the Willow typeface that very closely resembles a style for which Scottish designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh was known. The only time the show's signature font changed within its 12 seasons was in season 9, in which a "slasher" style font was used. However, the original font can still be seen, as it is used for "A", "H", "O" and "FX".</p>



<h2>Promotion</h2>
<p>As part of the promotion for the series, FX launched a "House Call" campaign, in which viewers at home could sign up and come face-to-face with a character from the series. Prior to the series premiere, FX released several clues to shine light on the series. They were offered on the show's official YouTube channel. Ten clues were released. In September 2011, FX launched a website which allows visitors to tour the Murder House throughout the decades and look for clues.</p>

<p>In August 2012, the first promo for the second season was released on the <i>American Horror Story</i> Facebook page entitled "Special Delivery", in which a nun carries a couple of buckets filled with body parts through a field. As a church bell rings, the nun empties one bucket's bloody contents, leaving the empty bucket behind, and resumes her trek. Over 20 subsequent teasers were released. Four photos were also released on EW.com. Two televised teasers, titled "Meet the Residents", were released on August 31, 2012. They feature the patients and some staff (such as Dr. Thredson, played by Zachary Quinto, and Sister Mary Eunice, played by Lily Rabe) lying in twin beds and dealing with their individual issues as the heads of the asylum (Jessica Lange, Joseph Fiennes and James Cromwell) look on. The song "Que Sera, Sera", mixed with the show's theme music, plays. To promote <i>Cult</i>, a competition was set up where fans who donated to the Children's Hospital Los Angeles could get a chance to get a walk-on role in an episode, and lunch with Evan Peters.</p>

<p>Overall, premises and characters for each season are typically kept under wraps until soon before premiers and are alluded to with brief and vague teaser trailers.</p>

<p>In October 2020, the owners of the historic Alfred Rosenheim Mansion "The Murder House" hosted a virtual paranormal investigation. The house had been featured in several films, TV shows, and music videos including the first season of <i>American Horror Story</i>. A production crew set up 15 cameras throughout the home and featured Hollywood psychic Patti Negri, exorcist Bishop James Long, Michelle Belanger, and other notable guests.</p>

<h3>Universal's Halloween Horror Nights</h3>
<p>On August 16, 2016, FX announced a deal had been struck to feature an <i>American Horror Story</i> maze at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Orlando for their Halloween Horror Nights events. The maze featured sets and themes from <i>Murder House</i>, <i>Freak Show</i>, and <i>Hotel</i>. Universal Parks &amp; Resorts said of the experience, "Twisted scenes from <i>Murder House</i> will unleash the evil spirits that possess the Harmon estate, spiraling guests through decades of the tortured dead who previously resided there. In <i>Freak Show</i>, guests joined a troupe of biological misfits in a sinister sideshow where they were stalked by the murderous and deformed Twisty the Clown. Finally, guests succumbed to the warped desires of the Countess after checking into the haunted Hotel Cortez, conceived from the beginning as a torture chamber for its customers." In 2017, the show returned as haunted attractions to both parks, with Universal Orlando having an attraction based on <i>Asylum</i>, <i>Coven</i>, and <i>Roanoke</i>, and Universal Studios Hollywood basing their attraction solely on <i>Roanoke</i>.</p>

<p>In December 2017, The Walt Disney Company announced it would purchase 21st Century Fox which included the 20th Century Fox film and TV assets. The deal was completely finalized on March 20, 2019, making 20th Century Fox officially part of The Walt Disney Studios. As Disney and Universal are bitter rivals in the theme park business (especially for their Central Florida properties), this would likely end the franchise's presence in Halloween Horror Nights at Universal parks.</p>

<h3>The Night Bites Bakery</h3>
<p>On July 14, 2021, an <i>American Horror Story</i> themed bakery opened in New York's Meatpacking District in Manhattan until July 24, 2021, to celebrate the release of spin-off <i>American Horror Stories</i> and the tenth season titled <i>Double Feature</i>. Guests had to be over the age of 18 to enter the bakery. Guests also had to make reservations for 30 minute visits. It featured sweet treats inspired by the series, as well as unique designs and characters based on past installments of <i>American Horror Story</i> and <i>American Horror Stories</i>. After placing an order, the Rubber Woman, introduced in the first episode of <i>American Horror Stories</i>, delivered the order through a secret window. It opened in Los Angeles from August 4, 2021, until August 14, 2021, in Beverly Grove. The bakery opened in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where the first part of the tenth season were filmed, at Pat's Happy Park on September 1, 2021, until September 4, 2021.</p>

<p>The first season, <i>American Horror Story: Murder House</i>, received generally positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 72% of 147 critics gave the first season a positive review. The site's consensus stated: "Convoluted yet effective, <i>American Horror Story</i> is strange, gory, and twisted enough to keep viewers hooked." The first season scored 62 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 30 reviews, indicating generally favorable reviews. Ken Tucker from <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> awarded the pilot episode a B+, stating: "<i>AHS</i> is pretty much all scare, all the time: a whole lotta screams, sex, jolts, mashed faces, psychotic behavior, and dead babies." Hank Stuever from <i>The Washington Post</i> said in his review that: "Overdoing things is one of Murphy's trademark flaws, but this show has a captivating style and giddy gross-outs." Not all reviews were favorable: Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave the series a D−, saying: "It is so far over the top that the top is a microscopic speck in its rearview mirror, and so full of strange sounds, sights and characters that you likely won't forget it—even though many of you will wish you could." Sepinwall would later go on to call it one of the worst TV shows of 2011. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i>' Mary McNamara gave it a mixed review, stating that it "collapses into camp... upon more than one occasion" but also noting that it is "hard to look away."</p>

<p>The second season, <i>American Horror Story: Asylum</i>, received critical acclaim from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 84% of 220 critics gave the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: "<i>American Horror Story: Asylum</i> crosses boundaries to shock and scare with sexy subplots and some innovative takes on current social issues." It scored 65 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 23 reviews, indicating generally favorable reviews. James Poniewozik from <i>Time</i> stated: "<i>AHS: Asylum</i> feels like a more focused, if equally frenetic, screamfest. It's also gorgeously realized, with a vision of its '60s institution setting so detailed you can smell the stale air and incense." Maureen Ryan of <i>The Huffington Post</i> said: "It's to the credit of <i>Asylum</i>'s writers, directors and cast that the emotional pain of the characters often feels as real as their uncertainty and terror." Verne Gay from <i>Newsday</i> gave the season a C grade, stating it "has some good special effects, just not much of a story to hang them on." Linda Stasi of the <i>New York Post</i> thought the season was "over the top," adding: "I need to enter [an asylum] myself after two hours of this craziness."</p>

<p>The third season, <i>American Horror Story: Coven</i>, received critical acclaim from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 85% of 221 critics gave the season a positive review. The site's consensus reads: "A noteworthy ensemble cast combined with creepy storytelling and campy, outrageous thrills make <i>American Horror Story: Coven</i> a potently structured fright-fest." It scored 71 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 24 reviews, the second-highest score for any season, after <i>Roanoke</i>, on that site. In their post-season reviews, <i>The Michigan Daily</i> gave <i>Coven</i> a B+, saying, "And while its conclusion, appropriately titled "The Seven Wonders", never quite matched the high standard it set for itself throughout the season, <i>Coven</i>'s reputation will nonetheless remain a solid one." Not all reviews were positive, however, with criticism focused on both the story and character arcs in the second half of the season. <i>The A.V. Club</i> gave this season the low rating of a D+, with critic Emily VanDerWerff remarking: "It lurched drunkenly from idea to idea, never settling on one long enough to build anything of worth."</p>

<p>The fourth season, <i>American Horror Story: Freak Show</i>, received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 77% of 202 critics gave the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: "Though it may turn off new viewers unaccustomed to its unabashed weirdness, <i>Freak Show</i> still brings the thrills, thanks to its reliably stylish presentation and game cast." This season was Jessica Lange's final major performance on the show; however, it was not her last appearance. It scored 69 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 19 reviews with a user score of 7.1 based on 509 user ratings, indicating generally favorable reviews.</p>

<p>The fifth season, <i>American Horror Story: Hotel</i>, received more mixed reviews from critics, in comparison to its predecessors. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 64% of 214 critics gave the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: "Favoring garish style over effective storytelling, the fifth <i>American Horror Story</i> strands a talented cast at Ryan Murphy's Hotel." <i>Hotel</i> scored a 60 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 24 reviews, indicating mixed or average reviews. Some praise the season for its increased amount of horror elements and experimentation, while many believe that Jessica Lange's departure negatively impacted the show's ratings and the overall character of the series moving forward. Dan Fienberg of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> gave a positive review, writing, "Early on, Hotel hasn't hooked me with its storytelling, but it's always fun to see what the series does with its repertory acting company and with new additions. Throw in the normal grotesquerie and visual panache, and that should keep me going for a while, even if all of the humor appears to have been funneled into <i>Scream Queens</i>." On the other hand, Matt Zoller Seitz of <i>New York Magazine</i> found the season "confusing, tedious, annoyingly precious, and often ostentatiously brutal", but also praised it for being "darkly beautiful, deeply weird, and (sometimes) exhilarating." Although Scott D. Pierce from <i>The Salt Lake Tribune</i> praised the production design and the cinematography, he said "the storytelling is derivative; the scares are non-existent; and it's all about style without much substance." Mike Hale from <i>The New York Times</i> complained that it "suffers from the absence of Jessica Lange". <i>IGN</i>'s Matt Fowler gave a rating of 5.9 out of 10, criticizing the season as "mediocre" and concluding "all weight and meaning is gone."</p>

<p>The sixth season, <i>American Horror Story: Roanoke</i>, received mostly positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 74% of 160 critics gave the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: "<i>American Horror Story: My Roanoke Nightmare</i> takes a surprising turn away from prior <i>AHS</i> formats, revisiting the deliberate pace of earlier seasons on a spookier, smaller scale, even if the true-crime format feels overdone." It scored a 72 on Metacritic based on nine reviews, making it the highest-scored season on that site.</p>

<p>The seventh season, <i>American Horror Story: Cult</i>, received mostly positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 73% of 218 critics gave the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: "<i>American Horror Story: Cult</i> intrigues with timely, over-the-top creepiness– and lots of clowns– despite being hampered by broad political generalizations and occasional holes in the narrative's logic." It scored a 66 on Metacritic based on 24 reviews, indicating generally favorable reviews.</p>

<p>The eighth season, <i>American Horror Story: Apocalypse</i>, received positive reviews from critics, with some considering it as an improvement over the recent seasons. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 79% of 193 critics gave the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: "Ryan Murphy and his murderers' row of witchy performers literally save the world—and franchise—in Apocalypse, the series most ambitious crossover swing yet." It scored a 63 on Metacritic based on six reviews, indicating generally favorable reviews.</p>

<p>The ninth season, <i>American Horror Story: 1984</i>, received critical acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 88% of 170 critics gave the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: "A near-perfect blend of slasher tropes and <i>American Horror Story</i>'s trademark twists, <i>1984</i> is a bloody good time."</p> 

<p>The tenth season, <i>American Horror Story: Double Feature</i>, received positive reviews. The first part of the season, <i>Red Tide</i>, received very positive reviews from critics, while the finale was received negatively. The second part, <i>Death Valley</i>, received mixed-to-positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reports an 80% approval rating, based on 61 reviews for the season, with an average rating of 9.00/10. The site's consensus is: "Though its second tale is still a mystery, the first half of <i>Double Feature</i> proves a spine-tingling good time with terrific performances – especially from the spectacular Leslie Grossman and Frances Conroy." Liz Shannon Miller of <i>Collider</i> stated <i>Double Feature</i> manages to be one of the best <i>American Horror Story</i> seasons ever created, writing, "For 10 seasons now, <i>American Horror Story</i> has represented the wildest excesses of the Ryan Murphy brand — incredible casts, deliberately outlandish premises and plots, and experiments in form which explode the ideas of what's possible on television." Riley Runnells of <i>The Post</i> praised the performances of the actors and complimented the writing, claiming, "The vibe of the show is almost more of a movie style and more professional-seeming than any other season so far. Not only are there incredible acting and technical moments, but the writing seems more polished and original than the more recent seasons of the show – especially the fresh take on a vampire plot." Andy Swift of <i>TVLine</i> applauded the performances of the cast members and stated the season succeeds to be terrifying, saying, "Chilling, compelling and wonderfully acted, <i>Double Feature</i> already feels like a return to form for the long-running franchise." Kayla Cobb of <i>Decider</i> said <i>Double Feature</i> succeeds to be frightening across its jumpscares and characters, while praising the performances of the actors, stating, "If you're into <i>American Horror Story</i> for the horror, you're going to have a blast. If not, then <i>Double Feature</i> has some killer performances from your favorites that you won't want to miss." Matt Fowler of <i>IGN</i> rated the season 7 out of 10, stating, "The first two episodes of the first half of <i>American Horror Story: Double Feature</i> start slow, but then amplify the intrigue with an interesting spin on vampires." Ron Hogan of <i>Den of Geek</i> rated the season 3 out of 5 stars, saying, "There are some very clever transitions between scenes, and the episode has good flow without getting slowed down during exposition dumps. The effects are used as appropriate punchlines, and <i>American Horror Story</i> is never shy about blood and gore when necessary. It (the half-season, not the episode) just felt a little too rushed, with too many ideas and not quite enough development."</p>

<p>The eleventh season, <i>American Horror Story: NYC</i>, received mostly positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 71% of seven critics gave the season a positive review.</p>

<p>The twelfth season, <i>American Horror Story: Delicate</i>, holds a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 73% with an average rating of 4.6/10, based on 11 critic reviews. The site's consensus reads: "<i>American Horror Story</i> reins in its Grand Guignol excess for a softer touch in <i>Delicate</i>, refreshing the series' formula with a slow-burn chiller about the anxieties of pregnancy." Meanwhile, Metacritic assigned a score of 51 out of 100 based on 6 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".</p>

<p>Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk have been credited with creating a series that increases both the LGBT creators and storylines in the industry. Theresa L. Geller and Anna Marie Banker have stated that Murphy and Falchuk utilize "the formal structure of the serialized anthology...to present serial narratives made by and about 'queers,' openly subverting gender and sexual norms that define the majority of television." In the journal <i>Gender Forum</i>, Robert Sevenich further acknowledges that "<i>American Horror Story</i> is a unique and challenging text that confronts issues of queer visibility, provides queer performers and creators a vehicle to contribute to cultural conversations, and gives audiences a lens to glean meaning."</p>
