<h1>All Out (2023)</h1>


<div>All Elite Wrestling pay-per-view event</div>

<p>The 2023 <b>All Out</b> was the fifth annual All Out professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It took place during Labor Day weekend on September 3, 2023, at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, breaking its tradition of All Out taking place at the Now Arena, located in the Chicago metro area—not including the 2020 event due to the COVID-19 pandemic that year.</p>

<p>Thirteen matches were contested at the event, including three on the Zero Hour pre-show. In the main event, Jon Moxley defeated Orange Cassidy to win the AEW International Championship. In other prominent matches, Konosuke Takeshita defeated Kenny Omega, Luchasaurus defeated Darby Allin to retain the AEW TNT Championship, and Bryan Danielson defeated Ricky Starks in a No Disqualification Strap match. All Out was also notable for an appearance by C.J. Perry (formerly known as Lana in WWE) in what was her first professional wrestling appearance since 2021. This was also the first All Out in which the AEW World Championship was not defended, although the reigning champion, MJF, did perform on the event.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>All Out is a pay-per-view (PPV) held annually during Labor Day weekend by All Elite Wrestling (AEW) since 2019. It is one of AEW's "Big Four" PPVs, which also includes Double or Nothing, Full Gear, and Revolution, their four biggest shows produced quarterly. During the Forbidden Door PPV on June 25, 2023, AEW announced that the fifth All Out event would take place on September 3 at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, breaking its previous tradition of being held at the Now Arena, located in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, Illinois—not including the 2020 event due to the COVID-19 pandemic that year. Additionally as part of All Out week, it was revealed that AEW's weekly television programs, <i>Wednesday Night Dynamite</i> and <i>Friday Night Rampage</i>, would be held at the Now Arena on August 30, with <i>Dynamite</i> airing live that night and <i>Rampage</i> airing on tape delay on September 1, and then <i>Saturday Collision</i> airing live from the United Center on September 2 the night before All Out. Tickets for all the events went on sale on July 14.</p>

<h3>Storylines</h3>
<p>All Out featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines were produced on AEW's weekly television programs, <i>Dynamite</i>, <i>Collision</i>, and <i>Rampage</i>.</p>

<p>On July 21 at <i>Rampage</i>: Royal Rampage, Darby Allin won the Royal Rampage Battle Royal to earn an AEW TNT Championship match against Luchasaurus at All Out.</p>

<p>On the August 12 episode of <i>Collision</i>, Powerhouse Hobbs said the next chapter of his book would be labeled "redemption". He then called out "The Redeemer", Miro, who came out but was attacked by Nick Comoroto and Aaron Solo. Miro cleared Comoroto and Solo from the ring, but then Hobbs put him down with a spinebuster and dropped his book on Miro's chest. The following week at <i>Collision</i>: Fight for the Fallen, after Hobbs' match, Miro appeared on the big screen and taunted Hobbs over his book. Later, a match between Miro and Hobbs was announced for All Out. During the All In <i>Zero Hour</i> pre-show, they signed the contract for the match, which ended in a brawl.</p>

<p>During <i>Dynamite</i>: Fyter Fest on August 23, Ruby Soho warned Kris Statlander that she would be going after her and the AEW TBS Championship. During that same week's <i>Rampage</i>: Fyter Fest, Statlander attacked Soho. The following night on <i>Collision</i>: Fyter Fest, Soho officially challenged Statlander for the TBS Championship at All Out, which Statlander accepted.</p>

<p>At All In, Konosuke Takeshita pinned Kenny Omega in a six-man tag team match to give his team the victory. During the All In media scrum, after Don Callis requested the bout, AEW president Tony Khan announced that Omega would face Takeshita at All Out.</p>

<p>For weeks, Orange Cassidy had been involved in feuds with the Blackpool Combat Club (Jon Moxley, Claudio Castagnoli, and Wheeler Yuta). On August 16 during <i>Dynamite</i>: Fight for the Fallen, he retained the AEW International Championship against Yuta. At All In just over a week later, he scored the win for his team in the Stadium Stampede match by pinning Castagnoli. During the All In post-event media scrum, Cassidy said that with pins over both Yuta and Castagnoli, he now wanted to pin Moxley next. It was then announced that if Cassidy retained the International Championship on the August 30 episode of <i>Dynamite</i>, he would get his chance to face Moxley in a title defense at All Out. Cassidy retained, thus officially scheduling the match.</p>

<p>On the August 5 episode of <i>Collision</i>, Ricky Starks challenged CM Punk for the "Real World Championship", with Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat serving as the special outside enforcer due to Stark cheating his way to defeat Punk in their prior two matches, including the finals of the Owen Hart Cup. After the match, Starks assaulted Steamboat with the latter's own belt. As a result of his actions against Steamboat, AEW (kayfabe) suspended Starks for 28 days. However, Starks acquired a manager's license in order to continue appearing in AEW. On August 30, Tony Khan announced that on the September 2 episode, Starks would issue a challenge to Steamboat for a strap match at All Out. There, Starks signed a match contract for the bout against Steamboat. However, as the contract just said "The Dragon", "The American Dragon" Bryan Danielson then made his return from injury and signed the contract instead of Steamboat, thus scheduling Starks to face Danielson in the strap match at All Out.</p>
